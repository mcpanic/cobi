Mobile First. Agile Development. Lean UX. Crowdsourcing. Machine Learning. In a world that has been disrupted by new technologies and approaches, what does it mean to do “front-end” or “user-centered design”? Are we relying on methods that are too rooted in the past? What techniques are succeeding and what changes do we need to be making? Do we need different data collected, different styles of prototyping, different design principles, and ways of structuring products or apps when building across multiple platforms? How will any changes in UCD techniques be received by current professionals as well as product managers and developers? This panel explores whether user research and design methods as we know them need to be radically overhauled, or some even eliminated. ","1.

Johan was unable to participate so we have confirmed in his place Ilpo Koskinen, professor of industrial design at Aalto University. Ilpo will bring a multi-national perspective to our panel. We appreciate the suggestion to include a panelist from the start-up world or from Google which has been pushing the mobile-first approach. However, we were unable to find a confirmed panelist in the short amount of time available to do so. However, several panelists have experience designing for mobile devices and will bring that to the panel. Panelists also have experience working with Agile development and integrating UX into Agile processes. Finally, we will be sure to talk about how the various methods have been adopted and modified for use.  \ ","","earlyrelease","","","Jan  7 09:15",""

A subset of HCI researchers and practitioners worldwide have been working to design, build, evaluate and deploy solutions for the 80% of the world which lives on less than $10 a day[2] and broadly for humanitarian efforts that improves people’s lives at large. However, a large section of the HCI community is still not directly involved in this space even if they are interested, because of concerns like job uncertainty, lack of awareness of avenues to help, time availability and perhaps some delusions about the space. This panel brings together panelists who are HCI professionals trying to produce social impact from four different domains (non-profit, for-profit social enterprise, academic research and corporate research) and are from different geographies and stages in their careers. . The panel explores how HCI researchers and practitioners can consider HCI-related careers in international development and other societal impact initiatives, introduce the CHI community to different means through which they could make meaningful contributions, discuss why it may be imminent for HCI specialists to apply their expertise to this space, cite and discuss some real world stories and try to answer as many queries from people who would like to get involved either as volunteers or for full-time careers.","1.

There is a significant opportunity to incorporate human-centered design into healthcare through the synthesis of deep healthcare domain expertise, visual and industrial design, human factors theory and practice, and an understanding of the patient experience. In practice, the need for such synthesis brings together professionals who often have distinct understanding of the meaning of design in healthcare and the ways in which design can solve problems in healthcare. As such, each professional encounters distinct challenges in trying to realize good design in healthcare. This panel will bring together the contrasting perspectives of industry, academia, visual design, clinicians, patients, and human factors consultants on the role of user interface and technology design in healthcare. Each representative speaker will share his/her experience, lessons learned, and thoughts on the role and meaning of design in healthcare.

We have revised the submission to improve the readability. In response to the main concern regarding the predominantly Canadian representation in the choice of panelists, we discussed the suggestion to replace at least one panel member. We concluded that it will be difficult to find a new panelist in the short time frame. The main consideration was that the panel brings together professionals, most of whom do not usually attend the CHI conference (e.g. a clinician, a patient, a medical technology vendor representative). The conference travel and registration requirement to participate is a barrier to securing the presence of such panelists from other countries. Having said that, we would like to emphasize that one of our panelists is from the U.S. (Sara Waxberg) and two other panelists (Joseph Cafazzo and Svetlena Taneva)regularly work on international consulting projects with global companies based on different continents and evaluating their product designs around the globe. In addition, we will strongly encourage the international audience at CHI to contribute their perspectives during the panel. Hence, we are confident that the panel will be able to bring out the challenges and perspectives encountered internationally.","","earlyrelease","","","Jan  7 17:58",""
