Not coincidentally, these traits are also the ones that education has traditionally demonized and designated as its major enemies: stupidity, ignorance and nonsense. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the positive aspects of these defamed traits but also provide practical advice on how they can be used for sparking and nurturing creative thinking and innovative design.","1.

There is growing interest in mining these resources for task modeling, automation, machine-guided help, interface search, and other applications. As a first step, past work has shown success in extracting individual commands from textual instructions. In this paper, we ask: How much further do we have to go to more fully interpret or automate a tutorial? We take a bottom-up approach, asking what it would take to: (1) interpret individual steps, (2) follow sequences of steps, and (3) locate procedural content in larger texts.","1.

This paper describes the ethos and approach of a recent conference (Research Through Design (RTD)), which introduced a novel format foregrounding the research artifact through both exhibition and dialogical round-table discussion sessions. We document critical reflections from organizers and delegates, which demonstrate how this format offers a more synergistic approach for the dissemination of ‘research through design’, and discuss key practical and philosophical challenges therein, contributing to a broader discussion of what it means to practice research through design as a form of inquiry.","1.

Initially Brainput was found to improve performance on a human-robot team task by adapting a robot's autonomy using NIRS-based classifications of the user's multitasking states. However, the failure to find any performance improvements in a follow-up study prompted reinvestigation of the original system via a reanalysis of Brainput's signal processing on a larger NIRS dataset and a placebo-controlled replication using random (instead of NIRS-based) state classifications. This reinvestigation revealed confounds in the original study responsible for the initial performance improvements, thus indicating that further work in signal processing is necessary to achieve reliable NIRS-based BCIs.","1.

Broadcasters see this as an \   opportunity to enhance a TV programme through the provision of \   additional information to the `second screen', but determining how \   to optimise this experience is one of the grand challenges currently \   facing content providers. Addressing this issue requires a detailed \   understanding of interaction with both the TV and the secondary \   device, but this new form of HCI, as much about passive consumption \   as active interaction, is not well represented by typical task-based \   paradigms. This paper describes experiments that use eye tracking to \   understand one of the key components of this new area of study --- \   determining which device is currently receiving the user's attention \   -- and discusses the considerable challenge of accurately monitoring \   attention while maintaining ecological validity. \ ","1.

However, within the medical sciences the notion of concordance also exists. Concordance promotes negotiation between the patient and healthcare professional for forging a therapeutic alliance. However, the HCI community has still not adopted concordance as a design ideal. This paper revisits four old design-cases to explore the role of concordance in out-of-clinic healthcare. We argue that concordance, as a design ideal, can guide new designs that promote a more active patient-role both at the clinic and beyond.","1.

Specifically, the form and language of erotic BDSM romance fiction, a genre that deals specifically with the nature of power in relationships, and which has proved extremely popular recently, are used as a means for provoking reflection on the nature of power in the human-computer relationship. Three sexually explicit scenarios are presented, in which technology is portrayed in a dominant and controlling role, highlighting the often subservient and apologetic nature of human interaction with technology. We suggest that readers offended by graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual behaviour do not read further than this abstract.","1. Ballard, J.G. Crash. Jonathan Cape, 1973. \ 2. Barker, M.

Medical images are usually considered as ordinary objects and their potential intimate value is never really considered. In this paper, we present an exploratory installation which anticipates prospective issues when medical and self-images interfere with each other. Primary Intimacy of being acts as a digital mirror reflecting the users' bodies with three-dimensional avatars, which are computed in real time from three medical imaging modalities (Fig. 1). A first evaluation reveals individual differences between users with respect to their personal privacy concerns while interacting with the installation. Thereafter, these issues may be probed in the scope of self-portraying. ","WARNING: Reference 32 starts with a non-alphanumeric character.  Please check it. \  \ 1. Le Breton, D.

It is quite arduous, if not impossible, to read all of these papers. One approach to deal with this information deluge is focusing on skimming through lots of papers in a short period of time, so that one can more wisely choose what to read before investing time to actually them them. In order to teach such skimming technique, I teach graduate-level students in an HCI course a technique, called ""Quick and Dirty Review (QnDReview)."" The method has been employed in the course for five semesters, and students' responses were collected and analyzed. Results showed that students reviewed about on average 4.3 minutes per paper and believe that they got a gist out of the paper. However, the bigger benefits we noticed are that students get the overall pictures of the fields and generate interesting ideas while exposing themselves to various new ideas through this approach.","1.
