Instead of generating UIs from simple abstractions, transforming them from high-level models should be more attractive. \\  \\ This course shows how human-computer interaction can be based on discourse modeling, even without employing speech or natural language. This topic is innovative, since it treats HCI interaction design and user-interface generation on the level of human-human communication. \\  \\ Communicative acts as abstractions from speech acts can model basic building blocks (&#8220;atoms&#8221;) of communication, like a question or an answer. When, e.g., a question and an answer are glued together as a so-called adjacency pair, a simple &#8220;molecule&#8221; of a dialogue is modeled. Deliberately complex discourse structures can be modeled using relations from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The content of a communicative act can refer to ontologies of the domain of discourse. Taking all this together, we created a new discourse metamodel that specifies what discourse models may look like. Such discourse models can specify a communicative interaction design. \\  \\ In this course, this modeling approach is explained in some detail, with a focus on the discourse models. Exercises both of understanding and creating such models are included as well. \\  \\ This course also demonstrates how such an interaction design can be used for automated user-interface generation.

We report the findings of a laboratory experiment investigating the effects of increased interruption workload demand on older adults' computerised cognitive test performance. Related work has reported interruptions having a range of inhibitory and facilitatory effects on primary task performance. Cognitive ageing literature suggests that increased interruption workload demand should have greater detrimental effects on older adults' performance, when compared to younger adults. With 36 participants from 3 age groups (20-54, 55-69, 70+), we found divergent effects of increased interruption demand on two primary tasks. Results suggest that older and younger adults experience interruptions differently, but at no age is test performance compromised by demanding interruptions. This finding is reassuring with respect to the success of a self-administered computerised cognitive assessment test, and is likely to be useful for other applications used by older adults.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"charlotte tang":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of British Columbia"}],"email":"scctang@cs.ubc.ca","firstName":"Charlotte","lastName":"Tang","middleName":"","submissions":["paper121","wo142"]},"claudia jacova":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of British Columbia"}],"email":"cjacova@mail.ubc.ca","firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Jacova","middleName":"","submissions":["paper121"]},"joanna mcgrenere":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of British Columbia"}],"email":"joanna@cs.ubc.ca","firstName":"Joanna","lastName":"McGrenere","middleName":"","submissions":["paper121","paper464"]},"matthew brehmer":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of British Columbia"}],"email":"brehmer@cs.ubc.ca","firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Brehmer","middleName":"","submissions":["paper121"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Interruptions in the home pose a threat to the validity of self-administered computerised cognitive testing.

Results suggest the combined presence of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues significantly improved the accuracy with which participants were able to assess gaze and hand pointing cues, and to instruct others on 3D body poses. The inclusion of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues also led to significant increases in the sense of social presence and telepresence reported by participants.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"audrey girouard":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"Carleton University"}],"email":"audrey_girouard@carleton.ca","firstName":"Audrey","lastName":"Girouard","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1830","in266","in265","paper1073"]},"jeremy cooperstock":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"McGill University"}],"email":"jer@cim.mcgill.ca","firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Cooperstock","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1830","in266"]},"john bolton":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"Human Media Lab, Queen's University"}],"email":"bolton@cs.queensu.ca","firstName":"John","lastName":"Bolton","middleName":"","submissions":["in246","paper1830","in266"]},"kibum kim":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"Human Media Lab, Queen's University"}],"email":"kibum@cs.queensu.ca","firstName":"Kibum","lastName":"Kim","middleName":"","submissions":["in246","paper1830","in266"]},"roel vertegaal":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"Human Media Lab, Queen's University"}],"email":"roel@cs.queensu.ca","firstName":"Roel","lastName":"Vertegaal","middleName":"","submissions":["in246","paper1830","in266","in265","paper1073"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Demonstrates a system for conveying 3D video conferencing using a cylindrical display.

A clear understanding of children&#65533;s headache characteristics is crucial for delivering appropriate treatment. However, current data collection methods were designed for adults often resulting in insufficient information. In this paper we present a novel method to help children communicate with health care providers and researchers about their headaches. It augments an existing child-centric method called Draw-and-Tell Conversation, which has already been shown to provide more actionable information from children than standard data collection methods.  It does so by enabling children to draw their symptoms on a zoomable drawing application, giving them the ability to provide more details and context than on paper. We present a study conducted with nineteen children aged 7 to 12 suggesting that children provided more information about their headaches when using the zoomable drawing application than when drawing on paper. This study provides a rare example of a mobile device used to enhance face-to-face interactions and contributes evidence of a specific benefit of zoomable user interfaces.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"juan pablo hourcade":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Iowa"}],"email":"hourcade@cs.uiowa.edu","firstName":"Juan Pablo","lastName":"Hourcade","middleName":"","submissions":["paper854","paper1487","wo113","pl116"]},"kelsey huebner":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Iowa"}],"email":"kelsey-huebner@uiowa.edu","firstName":"Kelsey","lastName":"Huebner","middleName":"E","submissions":["paper1487"]},"martha driessnack":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Iowa"}],"email":"martha-driessnack@uiowa.edu","firstName":"Martha","lastName":"Driessnack","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1487"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Provides evidence that zoomable multitouch app helps children with chronic headaches communicate more detailed descriptions of pain than paper-based alternatives.","contactEmail":"hourcade@cs.uiowa.edu","contactFirstName":"Juan Pablo","contactLastName":"Hourcade","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":["health"],"id":"paper1487","keywords":["children","pain","communication","headaches","draw","zoomable user interfaces","mobile devices","tablets"],"programNumber":"","session":["213"],"title":"Supporting Face-To-Face Communication Between Clinicians and Children with Chronic Headaches Through a Zoomable Multi-Touch App","type":"paper"},"paper654":{"abstract":"MOSOCO is a mobile assistive application that uses augmented reality and the visual supports of a validated curriculum, the Social Compass, to help children with autism practice social skills in real-life situations.

The need for interoperability in emergency communication systems has hastened the development of interoperable communication technology that is an enabling technology to automatically identify environmental variables including appropriate radio frequencies and to connect different networks used by different organizations.  Even though the technology has been researched from many perspectives and has shown the possibility to connect different organizations, there still remain many issues in terms of socio-cognitive aspects.  Thus, this study examines the socio-cognitive dimensions of interoperability, which equal the technical dimensions of the problem in importance.  The existential-phenomenological study reported here used semi-structured interviews to reconceptualize interoperability in the public safety communication domain.  Based on 11 interviews with public safety workers, five important factors were identified that have a major impact on the effectiveness of interoperable groups: information sharedness, operational awareness, communication readiness, adaptiveness, and coupledness.  Based on these main concepts, high-level suggestions are provided to guide the design of a new public safety communication system. The results can be directly applied to identify the requirements of communication systems and can be extended to design collaboration systems under stressful environments.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"charles w. bostian":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Virginia Tech"}],"email":"bostian@vt.edu","firstName":"Charles W.","lastName":"Bostian","middleName":"","submissions":["to113"]},"gyu hyun kwon":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Korea Institute of Science and Technology"}],"email":"ghkwon@kist.re.kr","firstName":"Gyu Hyun","lastName":"Kwon","middleName":"","submissions":["to113"]},"tonya l. smith-jackson":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Virginia Tech"}],"email":"smithjack@vt.edu","firstName":"Tonya L.","lastName":"Smith-Jackson","middleName":"","submissions":["to113"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"This research provides greater understanding of socio-cognitive aspects of interoperability in the context of public safety communications.

Our approach is to augment existing ten-finger QWERTY keyboards with multi-touch gestural input that can exist as a complement to the moded-keyboard approach. To inform our design, we conducted a study to elicit user-defined gestures from 20 participants. The final gesture set includes both multi-touch and single-touch gestures for commonly used non-alphanumeric text input. We implemented and conducted a preliminary evaluation of a touch-screen keyboard augmented with this technique. Findings show that using gestures for non-alphanumeric input is no slower than using keys, and that users strongly prefer gestures to a moded-keyboard interface.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"ben lee":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Washington"}],"email":"blee429@gmail.com","firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Lee","middleName":"Q","submissions":["paper1066"]},"jacob wobbrock":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Washington"}],"email":"wobbrock@u.washington.edu","firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Wobbrock","middleName":"O","submissions":["wo157","paper1147","paper1066","paper1065","paper657","paper1193"]},"leah findlater":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Washington"}],"email":"leah.findlater@gmail.com","firstName":"Leah","lastName":"Findlater","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1066","paper1065"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"We introduce a bimanual, multi-touch gestural approach for non-alphanumeric text input on touch-screen keyboards.

We asked 22 participants to input text under three mobility conditions (seated, slow walking, and normal walking) and three hand conditions (one-hand/portrait, two-hand/portrait, and two-hand/landscape). Results show that independently of hand condition, mobility significantly decreased input quality, leading to specific error patterns. Moreover, it was shown that target size can compensate the negative effect of walking, while two-hand interaction does not provide additional stability or input accuracy.

The paper describes the optimization process and resulting layouts for a standard trapezoid shaped keyboard and a more rectangular layout. Fitts' law modelling shows a predicted 11% improvement in entry speed without taking into account the significantly improved error correction potential and the subsequent effect on speed. In initial user tests typing speed dropped from approx. 21 wpm with Qwerty to 13 wpm (64%) on first use of our layout but recovered to 18 wpm (85%) within four short trial sessions, and was still improving. NASA TLX forms showed no significant difference on load between Qwerty and our new layout use in the fourth session. Together we believe this shows the new layouts are faster and can be quickly adopted by users.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"john levine":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Strathclyde"}],"email":"John.Levine@cis.strath.ac.uk","firstName":"John","lastName":"Levine","middleName":"","submissions":["paper814"]},"mark dunlop":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Strathclyde"}],"email":"mark.dunlop@cis.strath.ac.uk","firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Dunlop","middleName":"D","submissions":["wo157","paper814"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"Describes a new approach to keyboard layout optimization for faster text entry with better spell correction on touchscreen phones, while retaining familiarity with Qwerty.

In short, a user's interaction with an example continues well after the code is pasted. This paper investigates whether treating examples as \"first-class\" objects in the code editor - rather than simply as strings of text - will allow programmers to use examples more effectively. We explore this through the creation and evaluation of Codelets. A Codelet is presented inline with the user's code, and consists of a block of example code and an interactive helper widget that assists the user in understanding and integrating the example. The Codelet persists throughout the example's lifecycle, remaining accessible even after configuration and integration is done. A comparative laboratory study with 20 participants found that programmers were able to complete tasks involving examples an average of 43% faster when using Codelets than when using a standard Web browser.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"joel brandt":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Adobe Systems"}],"email":"joel.brandt@adobe.com","firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Brandt","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1283","cs164","si115"]},"stephen oney":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Carnegie Mellon University"}],"email":"soney@cs.cmu.edu","firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Oney","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1283"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Presents Codelets, which link interactive documentation with example code in code editors.

We propose a data-driven model for quality control in the context of crowdsourcing systems with the goal of assessing the quality of each individual contribution for parallel distributed tasks (allowing multiple people working on a same task). The model is initiated with a data training process providing a rough estimate for several quality-related performance measures (e.g. time spent on a task). The initial estimates are combined with observations of results produced by workers to estimate the quality for each individual contribution. We conduct a study to evaluate the model in the context of improving speech recognition-based text correction using MTurk services. Results indicate that the model accurately predicts quality for more than 92% of the non-negative (useful) contributions and 96% of the negative (useless) ones.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"andrew sears":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Rochester Institute of Technology"}],"email":"andrew.sears@rit.edu","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Sears","middleName":"","submissions":["wp164"]},"jinjuan feng":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"UMBC"}],"email":"jfeng@towson.edu","firstName":"Jinjuan","lastName":"Feng","middleName":"","submissions":["wp164"]},"shaojian zhu":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"UMBC"}],"email":"szhu1@umbc.edu","firstName":"Shaojian","lastName":"Zhu","middleName":"","submissions":["sr138","wp164"]},"shaun kane":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"UMBC"}],"email":"skane@umbc.edu","firstName":"Shaun","lastName":"Kane","middleName":"","submissions":["wp164"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"szhu1@umbc.edu","contactFirstName":"Shaojian","contactLastName":"Zhu","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp164","keywords":["crowdsourcing","quality control","parallel distribution"],"programNumber":"805","session":["232"],"title":"A Crowdsourcing Quality Control Model for Tasks Distributed in Parallel","type":"wp"},"wp172":{"abstract":"This article describes a new game mechanic called Game Entity Social Mapping (GESM) based on using social networking data fetched from a remote site about the player and his contacts to create characters, items or scenarios.

It consists of multiple projectors and transparent screens attached to actuators. The screens displaying the life-size faces are spatially arranged to recreate the actual scene. Screen pose is dynamically synchronized to the actual head motions of the participants to emulate their head motions, which typically indicate shifts in visual attention. Our hypothesis is that physical screen motion with image motion can boost the viewer's understanding of others' visual attention. Experiments suggest that viewers can more clearly discern the attention of meeting participants, and more accurately identify the addressees.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"dan mikami":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"NTT Communication Science Laboratories"}],"email":"mikami.dan@lab.ntt.co.jp","firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Mikami","middleName":"","submissions":["wp197","wp121"]},"junji yamato":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"NTT Communication Science Laboratories"}],"email":"yamato.junji@lab.ntt.co.jp","firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Yamato","middleName":"","submissions":["wp197","wp121"]},"kazuhiro otsuka":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"NTT Communication Science Laboratories"}],"email":"otsuka.kazuhiro@lab.ntt.co.jp","firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Otsuka","middleName":"","submissions":["wp197","wp121"]},"masafumi matsuda":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"NTT Communication Science Laboratories"}],"email":"matsuda.masafumi@lab.ntt.co.jp","firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Matsuda","middleName":"","submissions":["wp197","wp121"]},"shiro kumano":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"NTT Communication Science Laboratories"}],"email":"kumano.shiro@lab.ntt.co.jp","firstName":"Shiro","lastName":"Kumano","middleName":"","submissions":["wp197","wp121"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"otsuka.kazuhiro@lab.ntt.co.jp","contactFirstName":"Kazuhiro","contactLastName":"Otsuka","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp197","keywords":["face-to-face conversation","visual attention","projection mapping","multimodal interactions","telepresence"],"programNumber":"511","session":["232"],"title":"Reconstructing Multiparty Conversation Field by Augmenting Human Head Motions via Dynamic Displays","type":"wp"},"wp199":{"abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel approach to persuasive technology, based on children-parent interaction, to be implemented in a smart pad ludic application; to contribute to the natural resource consumption problem, not only by raising awareness, but by encouraging informed decisions on their use.

By using recognition algorithms, the system allows students to solve free-body diagrams and truss problems as if they were using a pen and paper. However, the system currently provides little support for students to edit their drawings by using free hand sketches. Specifically, students may wish to delete part or the whole of a line or shape, and the natural response is to scribble that part of shape out.  We developed a new method for integrating scribble gestures into a sketch recognition system. The algorithm automatically identifies and distinguishes scribble gestures from regular drawing input using three features. If the stroke is classified as a scribble, then the algorithm further decides which shape or which part of shape to be deleted. Instead of using slower brute-force methods, we use geometric-based linear-time algorithms which efficiently detect a scribble gesture and remove the intended shapes in real-time.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"tracy hammond":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Texas A &amp; M University"}],"email":"thammond@gmail.com","firstName":"Tracy","lastName":"Hammond","middleName":"","submissions":["wp292"]},"wenzhe li":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Texas A&amp;M University"}],"email":"nadalwz1115@gmail.com","firstName":"Wenzhe","lastName":"Li","middleName":"","submissions":["wp292"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"liwenzhe@tamu.edu","contactFirstName":"Wenzhe","contactLastName":"Li","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp292","keywords":["sketch recognition","pen-input computing","gesture recognition","editing"],"programNumber":"506","session":["232"],"title":"Using Scribble Gestures to Enhance Editing Behaviors of Sketch Recognition Systems","type":"wp"},"wp296":{"abstract":"In this paper, we present Wind Runners, which is a game designed for children with asthma.

This project tests two possible explanations for how coaches heighten motivation: the first is the straightforward explanation that coaching heightens self-efficacy, which in turn raises motivation; the second is the more novel idea that the quality of the pseudo-relationship between the virtual coach and the trainee is key to motivation. In an experiment comparing three systematically differing coaches, virtual coaches heightened both self-efficacy and parasocial interaction in some coaching conditions, but only parasocial interaction explained the patterns of results for intrinsic motivation. The findings have important theoretical implications for understanding the effects of parasocial interaction on health behaviors, with practical applications for the design of virtual coaches to improve health.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"jeana frost":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Netherlands","name":"VU Amsterdam"}],"email":"frost@media.mit.edu","firstName":"Jeana","lastName":"Frost","middleName":"","submissions":["wp319","wp317"]},"nora boukris":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Netherlands","name":"VU Public Result"}],"email":"nora_e.b@hotmail.com","firstName":"Nora","lastName":"Boukris","middleName":"","submissions":["wp317"]},"peter roelofsma":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Netherlands","name":"VU Amsterdam"}],"email":"p.h.m.p.roelofsma@vu.nl","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Roelofsma","middleName":"","submissions":["wp317"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"frost@media.mit.edu","contactFirstName":"Jeana","contactLastName":"Frost","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp317","keywords":["motivation health communication parasocial interaction virtual coaches"],"programNumber":"719","session":["232"],"title":"We Like to Move it Move it!

The proposed model aims to contribute to an informed game design process by focusing on six perspectives of player participation: Playfulness, Challenge, Embodiment, Sociability, Sensemaking and Sensoriality. These perspectives are then exercised along three operational levels: Intention, Artifact and Participation - the setting of gameplay experience goals, the characterization of the videogame object, and the evaluation of the player experience.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"licinio roque":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Portugal","name":"University of Coimbra"}],"email":"lir@dei.uc.pt","firstName":"Licinio","lastName":"Roque","middleName":"","submissions":["wp326"]},"luis lucas pereira":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Portugal","name":"University of Coimbra"}],"email":"lpereira@dei.uc.pt","firstName":"Luis Lucas","lastName":"Pereira","middleName":"","submissions":["wp326"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"lmlbpereira@gmail.com","contactFirstName":"Lu\u00eds","contactLastName":"Pereira","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp326","keywords":["game design","gameplay experience evaluation","participation"],"programNumber":"609","session":["232"],"title":"Towards a Game Experience Design Model Centered on Participation","type":"wp"},"wp344":{"abstract":"Multi-touch, wall-sized displays afford new forms of collaboration.

By creating a virtual human, the users will be able to transfer their mental model of the partner to a virtual human representation. Other people can then interact with the virtual human and provide feedback. The feedback will help the creator reduce the gap between their mental model of a partner and the actual qualities of the partner. Reducing this gap in perception is important in learning interpersonal skills.

Building on this survey, we are currently completing a series of focus groups that looks at how users pair reminders with multimodal presentations.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"julie williamson":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Glasgow"}],"email":"julie@dcs.gla.ac.uk","firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Williamson","middleName":"","submissions":["wp452"]},"marilyn mcgee-lennon":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Glasgow"}],"email":"mcgeemr@dcs.gla.ac.uk","firstName":"Marilyn","lastName":"McGee-Lennon","middleName":"","submissions":["wp452"]},"stephen brewster":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Glasgow"}],"email":"stephen.brewster@glasgow.ac.uk","firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Brewster","middleName":"","submissions":["wp352","wp452","wp438","wp108","paper531","si122","paper1046"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"julie@dcs.gla.ac.uk","contactFirstName":"Julie","contactLastName":"Williamson","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp452","keywords":["home care systems","multimodal interaction","user- centred design"],"programNumber":"718","session":["232"],"title":"What Colour is &#8216;Exercise?&#8217;  Designing Multimodal Reminders for the Home","type":"wp"},"wp459":{"abstract":"In this paper, we present MARBLS (Medical Alert Rule BuiLding System) - a visual end-user programming environment to facilitate the design and testing of clinical alert rules.

Summarization systems have the potential to provide significant assistance with navigating such repositories. Unfortunately, automatically-generated summaries often fall short of delivering the information needed by users. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that the natural language heuristics used to generate summaries are often optimized with respect to currently-used evaluation metrics. Such metrics simply score automatically-generated summaries against subjectively-classified gold standards without taking into account the usefulness of a summary in assisting a user achieve a certain goal or even overall summary coherence. We have previously shown that an immediate consequence of this problem is that even the most linguistically-complex summarization systems perform no better than basic heuristics, such as picking the longest sentences from a general-topic, spontaneous dialog, or the first few sentences from a news recording. Our hypothesis is that complex systems are in fact better, if measured properly. What is thus needed instead are evaluation metrics (and consequently, automatic summarizers) that incorporate features such as user preferences and task-orientation. For this, we propose an ecologically valid evaluation metric that determines the value of a summary when embedded in a task, rather than how closely a summary matches a gold standard.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"anthony mccallum":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Toronto"}],"email":"mccallum@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"McCallum","middleName":"","submissions":["wp519"]},"cosmin munteanu":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"National Research Council Canada"}],"email":"cosmin.munteanu@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca","firstName":"Cosmin","lastName":"Munteanu","middleName":"","submissions":["cs188","wp519","cr136"]},"gerald penn":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Toronto"}],"email":"gpenn@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Penn","middleName":"","submissions":["wp519","cr136"]},"xiaodan zhu":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"National Research Council Canada"}],"email":"xzhu@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"Zhu","middleName":"","submissions":["wp519"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"mccallum@cs.toronto.edu","contactFirstName":"Anthony","contactLastName":"McCallum","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp519","keywords":["speech summarization","user study","extrinsic evaluation"],"programNumber":"507","session":["232"],"title":"An Ecologically Valid Evaluation of Speech Summarization","type":"wp"},"wp520":{"abstract":"This work explores the role of channel switching, or switching between forms of face-to-face and mediated communication (e.g., text messaging, instant messaging) in romantic couple conflict.

While being a well-established interaction paradigm, a handheld device has serious drawbacks: it can be easily misplaced due to its mobility and in case of a touch screen interface, it also requires additional visual attention. Emerging interaction paradigms like 3D mid-air gestures using novel depth sensors such as Microsoft's Kinect aim at overcoming these limitations, but are known for instance to be tiring. In this paper, we propose to leverage the palm as an interactive surface for TV remote control. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we have explored the conceptual design space in an exploratory study.

Our results show that the palm has the potential to be leveraged for device-less and eyes-free TV interactions &#8211;without any third-party mediator device.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"florian m&#252;ller":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Technische Universit&#228;t Darmstadt"}],"email":"f_b.mueller@stud.tu-darmstadt.de","firstName":"Florian","lastName":"M&#252;ller","middleName":"","submissions":["wp538"]},"jochen huber":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Technische Universit&#228;t Darmstadt"}],"email":"jhuber@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de","firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Huber","middleName":"","submissions":["wo153","wp538","wp403","wp277"]},"max m&#252;hlh&#228;user":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Technische Universit&#228;t Darmstadt"}],"email":"max@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de","firstName":"Max","lastName":"M&#252;hlh&#228;user","middleName":"","submissions":["wp186","wo153","wp538","wp403","wp423","wp277"]},"mohammadreza khalilbeigi":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Technische Universit&#228;t Darmstadt"}],"email":"khalilbeigi@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de","firstName":"Mohammadreza","lastName":"Khalilbeigi","middleName":"","submissions":["wp538","wp423"]},"niloofar dezfuli":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Technische Universit&#228;t Darmstadt"}],"email":"niloo@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de","firstName":"Niloofar","lastName":"Dezfuli","middleName":"","submissions":["wp538","wp403"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"niloo@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de","contactFirstName":"Niloofar","contactLastName":"Dezfuli","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp538","keywords":["omnipresent","input","tv","device-less","eyes-free"],"programNumber":"802","session":["232"],"title":"Leveraging the Palm Surface  as an Eyes-free TV Remote Control","type":"wp"},"wp542":{"abstract":"In this paper we describe SINQ, a prototype web application that utilizes social participation to guide learners through the scientific inquiry process.

To reconcile these differences, we employ a need validation methodology to understand student needs in an intelligent tangible learning environment.

In addition, students value physical movement, interactivity, and perceived relevance to their learning objectives.

This modality of interaction limits users based on physical abilities. Our solution is a tool, called Myna, which is a voice-driven Java application executed parallel to Scratch. Myna processes voice commands from the user, interprets those commands according to a pre-defined grammar, and simulates synonymous actions of a mouse and keyboard within Scratch. The resulting environment assists those with a motor disability (particularly young children) in learning the joy of programming.

Instead of generating UIs from simple abstractions, transforming them from high-level models should be more attractive. \\  \\ This course shows how human-computer interaction can be based on discourse modeling, even without employing speech or natural language. This topic is innovative, since it treats HCI interaction design and user-interface generation on the level of human-human communication. \\  \\ Communicative acts as abstractions from speech acts can model basic building blocks (&#8220;atoms&#8221;) of communication, like a question or an answer. When, e.g., a question and an answer are glued together as a so-called adjacency pair, a simple &#8220;molecule&#8221; of a dialogue is modeled. Deliberately complex discourse structures can be modeled using relations from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The content of a communicative act can refer to ontologies of the domain of discourse. Taking all this together, we created a new discourse metamodel that specifies what discourse models may look like. Such discourse models can specify a communicative interaction design. \\  \\ In this course, this modeling approach is explained in some detail, with a focus on the discourse models. Exercises both of understanding and creating such models are included as well. \\  \\ This course also demonstrates how such an interaction design can be used for automated user-interface generation.

The field has moved from command-line interfaces for time-sharing to gesture interfaces for brain wave sleep monitors on your telephone. As Hal Varian has pointed out, we are in one of those unusual combinatorial periods in history where technology offers us a rich set of recombinable components that have been perfected but not yet incorporated into the fabric of society. Furthermore, significant innovations can now be done by smaller teams at more rapid rates and lower cost than before. In fact, the technology has allowed the rise of a digital culture of DIY hobbyists, exemplified by the Maker, Instructables, and Quantified Self Movements, who emphasize exploring the newly possible and just-in-time self-education, There are at least two interesting implications for HCI, I think. First is that we are in a new golden age for HCI, like the heady days when the GUI was being invented. New I/O devices are needed, new major interaction paradigms are possible, and CHI conferences should become more interesting. Second, the state of current technology and the spirit of the Maker Movement suggest a means for making progress on one of HCI&#8217;s oldest structural problems: how to ground the field, accelerate its progress, and make it cumulative by fashioning theories and incorporating them into practice. It is this latter point on which I wish to dwell. In this talk, I will attempt to sketch out, in the spirit of the times, what an interaction science for HCI could look like, how it might be incorporated into practice, and how it might be taught. \\  \\ BIO: Stuart Card works on the theory and design of human machine systems.

First, it leverages the \"wisdom of the crowd\", a continually evolving library of gesture shortcuts that are collected from the user population, to infer the meaning of gestures that a user never defined himself. Second, it combines an extensible template-based gesture recognizer with a specialized handwriting recognizer to even better address handwriting-based gestures, which are a common form of gesture shortcut.

It is time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to handle the complicated touch state transitions that result from multiple fingers and their simultaneous movements. In this paper, we present Gesture Coder, which by learning from a few examples given by the developer automatically generates code that recognizes multi-touch gestures, tracks their state changes and invokes corresponding application actions. Developers can easily test the generated code in Gesture Coder, refine it by adding more examples, and once they are satisfied with its performance integrate the code into their applications. We evaluated our learning algorithm exhaustively with various conditions over a large set of noisy data. Our results show that it is sufficient for rapid prototyping and can be improved with higher quality and more training data. We also evaluated Gesture Coder's usability through a within-subject study in which we asked participants to implement a set of multi-touch interactions with and without Gesture Coder. The results show overwhelmingly that Gesture Coder significantly lowers the threshold of programming multi-touch gestures.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"hao l&#252;":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Washington, Seattle"}],"email":"ryan.hlv@gmail.com","firstName":"Hao","lastName":"L&#252;","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1915"]},"yang li":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Google Research"}],"email":"yangli@acm.org","firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1915","paper1130"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"We present Gesture Coder, a tool for programming multi-touch gestures by demonstration.

As the number of custom gestures grows it becomes increasingly difficult to 1) know if new gestures will conflict with existing gestures, and 2) know how to extend existing code to reliably recognize the complete gesture set. Proton is a novel framework that addresses both of these problems. Using Proton, the application developer declaratively specifies each gesture as a regular expression over a stream of touch events. Proton statically analyzes the set of gestures to report conflicts, and it automatically creates gesture recognizers for the entire set. To simplify the creation of complex multitouch gestures, Proton introduces gesture tablature, a graphical notation that concisely describes the sequencing of multiple interleaved touch actions over time. Proton contributes a graphical editor for authoring tablatures and automatically compiles tablatures into regular expressions. We present the architecture and implementation of Proton, along with three proof-of-concept applications. These applications demonstrate the expressiveness of the framework and show how Proton simplifies gesture definition and conflict resolution.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"bj&#246;rn hartmann":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"bjoern@eecs.berkeley.edu","firstName":"Bj&#246;rn","lastName":"Hartmann","middleName":"","submissions":["in127","paper379","wp345","paper423"]},"kenrick kin":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"kenrick.kin@gmail.com","firstName":"Kenrick","lastName":"Kin","middleName":"","submissions":["paper423"]},"maneesh agrawala":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"maneesh@cs.berkeley.edu","firstName":"Maneesh","lastName":"Agrawala","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1768","paper554","paper423"]},"tony derose":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Pixar Animation Studios"}],"email":"derose@pixar.com","firstName":"Tony","lastName":"DeRose","middleName":"","submissions":["vi145","paper423"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Describes a framework that allows developers to declaratively specify multitouch gestures as regular expressions.

Techniques considered for automated segmentation of the eye movement recording into unique intervals include mouse/keyboard events and eye movement scanpaths. ES is identified by a number of eye movement metrics, including: fixation count, saccade amplitude, convex hull area, scanpath inflections, scanpath length, and scanpath duration. The ES intervals identified by each algorithm are compared to those produced by manual classification to verify the accuracy, precision, and performance of each algorithm. The results indicate that automated classification can be successfully employed to substantially reduce the amount of recorded data reviewed by HCI experts during usability testing, with relatively little loss in accuracy.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"corey holland":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Texas State University"}],"email":"ch1570@txstate.edu","firstName":"Corey","lastName":"Holland","middleName":"","submissions":["paper365"]},"dan tamir":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Texas State University - San Marcos"}],"email":"dt19@txstate.edu","firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Tamir","middleName":"","submissions":["paper365"]},"oleg komogortsev":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Texas State University"}],"email":"ok11@txstate.edu","firstName":"Oleg","lastName":"Komogortsev","middleName":"","submissions":["paper365","wp559"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Presents an evaluation of algorithms for the automated detection of excessive visual search, a technique that can be utilized to aid in the identification of usability problems during usability testing.","contactEmail":"ch1570@txstate.edu","contactFirstName":"Corey","contactLastName":"Holland","coreCommunities":["user experience"],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"paper365","keywords":["human-computer interaction","eye tracking","visual search","usability","usability testing"],"programNumber":"","session":["216"],"title":"Identifying Usability Issues via Algorithmic Detection of Excessive Visual Search","type":"paper"},"paper572":{"abstract":"Folder navigation is the main way that computer users retrieve their personal files.

The eLabBench supports the organization of personal information, capture of experimental work for later access, and the use of a variety of computational resources directly at the lab bench. We deployed the eLabBench in a biology laboratory for 16 weeks, and invited seven molecular biologists to run experiments on it. We report on how they used the bench and how it fitted within their larger experimental process. The main impact of the eLabBench lies in the changes it sparked off in preparing, running, and documenting lab experiments. By supporting computation at the bench and management of physical objects in the office, the eLabBench blurred the separation between office and laboratory work. Based on our observations, we discuss how interactive systems for laboratories such as the eLabBench can support a more exploratory or design-oriented way of \"doing\" science.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"aur&#233;lien tabard":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Denmark","name":"IT University of Copenhagen"}],"email":"auta@itu.dk","firstName":"Aur&#233;lien","lastName":"Tabard","middleName":"","submissions":["paper141"]},"jakob bardram":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Denmark","name":"IT University of Copenhagen"}],"email":"bardram@itu.dk","firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Bardram","middleName":"","submissions":["paper141","paper517"]},"juan david hincapi&#233; ramos":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Denmark","name":"IT University of Copenhagen"}],"email":"jdhr@itu.dk","firstName":"Juan David","lastName":"Hincapi&#233; Ramos","middleName":"","submissions":["paper141"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Describes the long-term deployment of the eLabBench, a tabletop system for laboratories.

Much research has made use of social context as a way to support information storage and re-finding.

In our research, we investigate how a person's physical-social interactions, in the form of co-presence, can be employed to support digital information management. We designed and implemented a system based on this concept and evaluated it in three two-month long case studies. Our system associates digital information used in social situations with co-present individuals through the use of automatic or manual tagging.  Our findings showed that although the three participants varied greatly in their information filing and information use strategies, they all accessed digital information using people or groups of people, thereby supporting our initial premise.  However, we found that the need to use digital information during social interactions arises only when there is a shared focus in the form of, for example, a large display, or when there is a social purpose for the information, for instance to share it with other meeting members at a later time. Our observations suggest the need for further research and innovation in technology affordances for real-time information use in physical-social interactions.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"blake sawyer":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"}],"email":"basawyer@vt.edu","firstName":"Blake","lastName":"Sawyer","middleName":"","submissions":["cs138"]},"francis quek":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech)"}],"email":"quek@cs.vt.edu","firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Quek","middleName":"","submissions":["cs138"]},"manuel perez-quinones":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"}],"email":"perez@cs.vt.edu","firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Perez-Quinones","middleName":"","submissions":["cs138"]},"mehul motani":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Singapore","name":"National University of Singapore"}],"email":"motani@nus.edu.sg","firstName":"Mehul","lastName":"Motani","middleName":"","submissions":["cs138"]},"sharon lynn chu yew yee":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"}],"email":"sharilyn@vt.edu","firstName":"Sharon Lynn","lastName":"Chu Yew Yee","middleName":"","submissions":["cs138"]},"wai choong wong":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Singapore","name":"National University of Singapore"}],"email":"elewwcl@nus.edu.sg","firstName":"Wai Choong","lastName":"Wong","middleName":"","submissions":["cs138"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"This case study presents a system that tracks when information is used during physical-social interactions and automatically tags information with people and groups of people (i.e., social orbits).","contactEmail":"basawyer@vt.edu","contactFirstName":"Blake","contactLastName":"Sawyer","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"cs138","keywords":["personal information management","re-finding","physical-social interactions","context","tagging"],"programNumber":"","session":["203"],"title":"Using Physical-Social Interactions to Support Information Re-finding","type":"cs"},"paper1350":{"abstract":"Facebook has become an increasingly important tool for people engaging in a range of communication behaviors, including requesting help from their social network to address information needs.

These mobile Q&amp;A services are very different from traditional Q&amp;A sites in that questions/answers are short in length and are exchanged via mobile devices (e.g., SMS or mobile Internet). While traditional Q&amp;A sites have been well investigated, so far little is known about the mobile Q&amp;A usage. To understand mobile Q&amp;A usage, we analyzed 2.4 million question/answer pairs spanning a 14 month period from Naver Mobile Q&amp;A and performed a complementary survey study of 555 active mobile Q&amp;A users. We find that mobile Q&amp;A is deeply wired into users' everyday life activities--its usage is largely dependent on users' spatial, temporal, and social contexts; the key factors of mobile Q&amp;A usage are accessibility/convenience of mobile Q&amp;A, promptness of receiving answers, and users' satisficing behavior of information seeking (i.e., minimizing efforts and settling with good enough information). We also observe that users tend to seek more factual information attributed to everyday life activities than they do on traditional Q&amp;A sites and that they exhibit unique interaction patterns such as repeating and refining questions as coping strategies in seeking information needs.

In addition, applying interactive machine learning to social network group creation introduces several challenges for designing effective end-user interaction with machine learning. We identify these challenges and discuss how we address them in ReGroup.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"daniel weld":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Washington"}],"email":"weld@cs.washington.edu","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Weld","middleName":"S.","submissions":["paper1699"]},"james fogarty":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Washington"}],"email":"jfogarty@cs.washington.edu","firstName":"James","lastName":"Fogarty","middleName":"","submissions":["paper657","paper1699"]},"saleema amershi":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Washington"}],"email":"samershi@cs.washington.edu","firstName":"Saleema","lastName":"Amershi","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1699"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Presents ReGroup, a novel end-user interactive machine learning system for helping people create custom, on-demand groups in online social networks.

Our findings show that participants were able to quickly build sound mental models of the recommender system's reasoning, and that participants who most improved their mental models during the study were significantly more likely to make the recommender operate to their satisfaction. These results suggest that by helping end users understand a system's reasoning, intelligent agents may elicit more and better feedback, thus more closely aligning their output with each user's intentions.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"irwin kwan":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Oregon State University"}],"email":"kwan@eecs.oregonstate.edu","firstName":"Irwin","lastName":"Kwan","middleName":"","submissions":["paper408"]},"margaret burnett":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Oregon State University"}],"email":"burnett@cs.orst.edu","firstName":"Margaret","lastName":"Burnett","middleName":"","submissions":["wo106","paper608","paper408","paper428","si115"]},"simone stumpf":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"City University London"}],"email":"Simone.Stumpf.1@city.ac.uk","firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Stumpf","middleName":"","submissions":["wo106","paper408"]},"todd kulesza":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Oregon State University"}],"email":"kuleszto@eecs.oregonstate.edu","firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Kulesza","middleName":"","submissions":["paper408"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"A user study exploring the effects of mental model soundness on end users personalizing an intelligent agent.

UX designers find that their old role relationships and procedures no longer work, their skills and techniques devalued, and there&#8217;s no clear guidance on how to contribute. \\  \\ But, looking at their base principles, Agile methods should be friendly to UX participation. Continuous user feedback is core to Agile&#8212;and who better to supply it than UX designers? But many Agile values and attitudes work against the needs of UX design.

The familiarity of pen and paper makes it a particularly attractive media for many user groups, including young children.

Currently, generating custom interactive paper documents involves some programming, limiting its use by many user groups (e.g., educators and families) who might especially benefit from application of hybrid paper-digital interfaces in their practices. To address this need, we developed an end-user Toolkit for Authoring Pen and Paper Language Activities (TAP &amp; PLAY). This paper describes the iterative development of the toolkit, its accessibility for novice non-technical users, and use in three different contexts for early language learning.

Comparing a remote upper-arm touch against a similarly timed flashing light, we explore the importance of the touch modality in affect conveyance.  Our second manipulation involves two cover stories where the listener is told that the touch or flashing light is triggered either by the storyteller expressively squeezing a touch input device while speaking, or by measured `high points' in the mental state of the storyteller. Our results show that the story accompanied by communicative touch resulted in a significant increase in the sense of connectedness with the storyteller over the speech-only condition, and a trend toward greater affective conveyance.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"adrian cheok":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University Graduate School of Media Design"}],"email":"adriancheok@mixedrealitylab.org","firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Cheok","middleName":"David","submissions":["paper791"]},"deborah tatar":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Center for Human Computer Interaction, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States"}],"email":"dtatar@cs.vt.edu","firstName":"Deborah","lastName":"Tatar","middleName":"","submissions":["paper791"]},"francis quek":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Center for Human Computer Interaction, Virginia Tech"}],"email":"quek@cs.vt.edu","firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Quek","middleName":"","submissions":["paper791"]},"keng soon teh":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Singapore","name":"National University of Singapore"}],"email":"james.tks@gmail.com","firstName":"Keng Soon","lastName":"Teh","middleName":"","submissions":["paper791"]},"rongrong wang":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Virginia Tech"}],"email":"wangr06@vt.edu","firstName":"Rongrong","lastName":"Wang","middleName":"","submissions":["paper791"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"Describes a remote touch study, showing communicative touch accompanied by speech can significantly influence people's sense of connectedness.

However, defining exactly which challenges are important and which aspects of gaming experience are affected is largely under-explored. In this paper, we investigate if altering the level of challenge in a videogame influences people's experience of immersion. Our first study demonstrates that simply increasing the physical demands of the game by requiring gamers to interact more with the game does not result in increased immersion.  In a further two studies, we use time pressure to make games more physically and cognitively challenging. We find that the addition of time pressure increases immersion as predicted.  We argue that the level of challenge experienced is an interaction between the level of expertise of the gamer and the cognitive challenge encompassed within the game.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"anna cox":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University College London"}],"email":"anna.cox@ucl.ac.uk","firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Cox","middleName":"L","submissions":["paper1330","paper1391","wp482","si112"]},"michael carroll":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of York"}],"email":"mjpc@cs.york.ac.uk","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Carroll","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1330"]},"pari shah":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University College London"}],"email":"zcjtbb4@ucl.ac.uk","firstName":"Pari","lastName":"Shah","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1330"]},"paul cairns":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of York"}],"email":"pcairns@cs.york.ac.uk","firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Cairns","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1330","wo114"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"Three experiments manipulate challenge of a video game.

We explain these perspectives by providing insights from the design and development process of an EU-funded serious game about conflict resolution developed by an interdisciplinary consortium of researchers and industry-based developers.

The results of our multivariate study of over 45,000 players show that the usefulness of tutorials depends greatly on game complexity.

An ameliorative discipline of both theory and practice, somaesthetics seeks to enrich not only our discursive knowledge of the body but also our lived somatic experience and performance; it aims to improve the meaning, understanding, efficacy, and beauty of our movements and of the environments to which our actions contribute and from which they also derive their energies and significance. To pursue these aims, somaesthetics is concerned with a wide diversity of knowledge forms and discourses, social practices and institutions, cultural traditions, values, and bodily disciplines that structure (or could improve) such somatic understanding and cultivation. As an interdisciplinary project that is not confined to one dominant academic field, professional vocabulary, cultural ideology, or particular set of bodily disciplines, somaesthetics aims to provide an overarching theoretical structure and a set of basic and versatile conceptual tools to enable a more fruitful interaction and integration of the very diverse forms of somatic knowledge currently being practiced and pursued. My talk at CHI will present the fundamental principles of the somaesthetic, examine some of its interdisciplinary impact and then explore its possible applications to the field of interactive design. \\  \\ BIO: Richard Shusterman is the Dorothy F.

Therefore, we carried out three user studies to analyze how each stage of flicking on a curved surface is influenced. Our main findings are: 1)  Flicking gestures are more accurate if horizontal and vertical surface are joined by a continuous curve than if they are separated by an edge or gap. 2) Flicking gestures on curved surfaces are mostly influenced by the motor execution stage of the gesture rather than the visual perception stage. 3) Flicking accuracy decreases as the starting point of the gesture is moved closer to the curve. 4) We conclude with a first mathematical model to estimate the error users will make when flicking across a curve.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"christine sutter":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"RWTH Aachen University"}],"email":"Christine.Sutter@psych.rwth-aachen.de","firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Sutter","middleName":"","submissions":["paper209"]},"jan borchers":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"RWTH Aachen University"}],"email":"borchers@cs.rwth-aachen.de","firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Borchers","middleName":"","submissions":["paper592","paper209","in267","paper104","paper1366","wp207","cs114"]},"lei wang":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"RWTH Aachen University"}],"email":"lei.wang@psych.rwth-aachen.de","firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","middleName":"","submissions":["paper209"]},"simon voelker":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"RWTH Aachen University"}],"email":"voelker@cs.rwth-aachen.de","firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Voelker","middleName":"","submissions":["paper209"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"This paper investigates flicking gestures on curved interactive surfaces.

Yet, asking workers with varying skills, backgrounds and motivations to simply \"Explain why a chart is interesting\" can result in irrelevant, unclear or speculative explanations of variable quality. To address these problems, we contribute seven strategies for improving the quality and diversity of worker-generated explanations. Our experiments show that using (S1) feature-oriented prompts, providing (S2) good examples, and including (S3) reference gathering, (S4) chart reading, and (S5) annotation subtasks increases the quality of responses by 28% for US workers and 196% for non-US workers. Feature-oriented prompts improve explanation quality by 69% to 236% depending on the prompt. We also show that (S6) pre-annotating charts can focus workers' attention on relevant details, and demonstrate that (S7) generating explanations iteratively increases explanation diversity without increasing worker attrition. We used our techniques to generate 910 explanations for 16 datasets, and found that 63% were of high quality.

However, hierarchical organisations are known to slow down expert users. This paper proposes the use of spatial memory in combination with hierarchy flattening as a means of improving GUI performance. We demonstrate these concepts through the design of a command selection interface, called CommandMaps, and analyse its theoretical performance characteristics. We then describe two studies evaluating CommandMaps against menus and Microsoft's Ribbon interface for both novice and experienced users. Results show that for novice users, there is no significant performance difference between CommandMaps and traditional interfaces -- but for experienced users, CommandMaps are significantly faster than both menus and the Ribbon.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"andrea bunt":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Manitoba"}],"email":"bunt@cs.umanitoba.ca","firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bunt","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1485","paper465"]},"andy cockburn":{"affiliations":[{"country":"New Zealand","name":"University of Canterbury"}],"email":"andy@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz","firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Cockburn","middleName":"","submissions":["paper465","paper484","paper1210"]},"carl gutwin":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Saskatchewan"}],"email":"gutwin@cs.usask.ca","firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Gutwin","middleName":"","submissions":["paper465","paper665","paper484"]},"joey scarr":{"affiliations":[{"country":"New Zealand","name":"University of Canterbury"}],"email":"joey.scarr@gmail.com","firstName":"Joey","lastName":"Scarr","middleName":"","submissions":["paper465"]}},"bestPaperAward":true,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Introduces CommandMap interfaces for mouse-based command invocation.

For example, dimensionality reduction methods use various similarity metrics to visualize textual document collections in a spatial metaphor, where similarities between documents are approximately represented through their relative spatial distances to each other in a 2D layout. This metaphor is designed to mimic analysts&#65533; mental models of the document collection and support their analytic processes, such as clustering similar documents together. However, in current methods, users must interact with such visualizations using controls external to the visual metaphor, such as sliders, menus, or text fields, to directly control underlying model parameters that they do not understand and that do not relate to their analytic process occurring within the visual metaphor. In this paper, we present the opportunity for a new design space for visual analytic interaction, called semantic interaction, which seeks to enable analysts to spatially interact with such models directly within the visual metaphor using interactions that derive from their analytic process, such as searching, highlighting, annotating, and repositioning documents. Further, we demonstrate how semantic interactions can be implemented using machine learning techniques in a visual analytic tool, called ForceSPIRE, for interactive analysis of textual data within a spatial visualization.  Analysts can express their expert domain knowledge about the documents by simply moving them, which guides the underlying model to improve the overall layout, taking the user&#65533;s feedback into account.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"alex endert":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Virginia Tech"}],"email":"aendert@cs.vt.edu","firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Endert","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1970"]},"chris north":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Virginia Tech"}],"email":"north@cs.vt.edu","firstName":"Chris","lastName":"North","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1970"]},"patrick fiaux":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Virginia Tech"}],"email":"pfiaux@cs.vt.edu","firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Fiaux","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1970"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Description of design space for user interaction for visual analytics called Semantic Interaction, coupling foraging and synthesis stages of sensemaking.

These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature.

Technological aids such as customized GPS navigation tools offer the chance to augment visually impaired pedestrians&#65533; sensory information with a richer depiction of an environment, but care must be taken to balance the need for more information with other demands on the senses. In this paper, we focus on the information needs of visually impaired pedestrians at intersections, which present a specific cause of stress when navigating in unfamiliar locations. We present a navigation application prototype called CrossingGuard that provides rich information to a user such as details about intersection geometry that are not available to visually impaired pedestrians today. A user study comparing content-rich information to a baseline condition shows that content-rich information raises the level of comfort that visually impaired pedestrians feel at unfamiliar intersections. In addition, we discuss the categories of information that are most useful. Finally, we introduce a micro-task approach to gather intersection data via Street View annotations that achieves 85.5% accuracy over the 9 categories of information used by CrossingGuard.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"khai truong":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Toronto"}],"email":"khai@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"Khai","lastName":"Truong","middleName":"N","submissions":["paper845","paper1716","paper1608","paper1607"]},"richard guy":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Toronto"}],"email":"guy@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Guy","middleName":"T","submissions":["paper1716","paper1607"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"User study to investigate the information needs of visually impaired pedestrians at intersections.

Particle filters are used to estimate the user's location based on the accelerometer data as well as the user confirming the presence of anticipated tactile landmarks along the provided path. Navatar has a high possibility of large-scale deployment, as it only requires an annotated virtual representation of an indoor environment.

ERN is triggered when a user either makes a mistake or the application behaves differently from their expectation. We first show that ERN can be seen on signals captured by EEG headsets like Emotiv&#65533; when doing a typical multiple choice reaction time (RT) task &#65533; Flanker task. We then present a single-trial online ERN algorithm that works by pre-computing the coefficient matrix of a logistic regression classifier using some data from a multiple choice reaction time task and uses it to classify incoming signals of that task on a single trial of data. We apply it to an interactive selection task that involved users selecting an object under time pressure. Furthermore the study was conducted in a typical office environment with ambient noise. Our results show that online single trial ERN detection is possible using off-the-shelf headsets during tasks that are typical of interactive applications. We then design a Superflick experiment with an integrated module mimicking an ERN detector to evaluate the accuracy of detecting ERN in the context of assisting users in interactive tasks. Based on these results we discuss and present several HCI scenarios for use of ERN.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"chi vi":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Bristol"}],"email":"chi.vi@bristol.ac.uk","firstName":"Chi","lastName":"Vi","middleName":"","submissions":["paper818"]},"sriram subramanian":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Bristol"}],"email":"sriramable@gmail.com","firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Subramanian","middleName":"","submissions":["paper634","paper1562","paper1055","paper818","in136"]}},"bestPaperAward":true,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Demonstrate the capabilities of an off-the-shelf headset in detecting Error Related Negativity on a single trial basis.

The method enables not only the quantification of arousing emotional states but also their disambiguation into positive or negative instances. The physiological channel targets sympathetic responses and is materialized as a perspiratory signal extracted from thermal imagery of the perinasal area. The observational channel is materialized via decoding of facial expressions. However, while such decoding is usually performed in the visible spectrum, the authors have developed an algorithm to carry this out in thermal imagery instead. Thus, thermal imaging is used for both physiological and observational analysis. The potential of this dual unobtrusive methodology is demonstrated with some examples from a stress study, where users (surgeons in this case) interact with laparoscopic training boxes.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"avinash wesley":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Houston"}],"email":"awesley@uh.edu","firstName":"Avinash","lastName":"Wesley","middleName":"","submissions":["cs169"]},"ioannis pavlidis":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Houston"}],"email":"ipavlidis@uh.edu","firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Pavlidis","middleName":"","submissions":["cs169"]},"peggy lindner":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Houston"}],"email":"plindner@uh.edu","firstName":"Peggy","lastName":"Lindner","middleName":"","submissions":["cs169"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Case study presents method that enables quantification and disambiguation of emotional arousal states.

Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lack-of-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the focused attention scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of focused attention, which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect.

Most of this research has focused on single-party communication (monologues), such as the way in which individuals either give or follow route instructions.  However, very little work has been reported on spatial navigation dialogues and whether there are gender differences in the way that they are conducted.  This paper will address the lack of research evidence by exploring the dialogues between partners of the same and of different gender in a simulated Human-Robot Interaction study.  In the experiments discussed in this paper, pairs of participants communicated remotely; in each pair, one participant (the instructor) was under the impression that s/he was giving route instructions to a robot (the follower), avoiding any perception of gendered communication.  To ensure the naturalness of the interaction, the followers were given no guidelines on what to say, however each had to control a robot based on the user&#8217;s instructions.  While many monologue-based studies suggest male superiority in a multitude of spatial activities and domains, this study of dialogues highlights a more complex pattern of results.  As anticipated, gender influences task performance and communication.  However, the findings suggest that it is the interaction &#8211; the combination of gender and role (i.e., instructor or follower) &#8211; that has the most significant impact.  In particular, pairs of female users/instructors and male &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers are associated with the fastest and most accurate completion of the navigation tasks.  Moreover, dialogue-based analysis illustrates how pairs of male users/instructors and female &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers achieved successful communication through &#8216;alignment&#8217; of spatial descriptions.  In particular, males seem to adapt the content of their instructions when interacting with female &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers and employ more landmark references compared to female users/instructors or when addressing males (in male-male pairings).  This study describes the differences in how males and females interact with the system, and proposes that any female &#8216;disadvantage&#8217; in spatial communication can disappear through interactive mechanisms.  Such insights are important for the design of navigation systems that are equally effective for users of either gender.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"robert d. macredie":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Brunel University"}],"email":"robert.macredie@brunel.ac.uk","firstName":"Robert D.","lastName":"Macredie","middleName":"","submissions":["to122"]},"sherry chen":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"National Central University"}],"email":"sherry@cl.ncu.edu.tw","firstName":"Sherry","lastName":"Chen","middleName":"","submissions":["to122"]},"stanislao lauria":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Brunel University"}],"email":"stasha.lauria@brunel.ac.uk","firstName":"Stanislao","lastName":"Lauria","middleName":"","submissions":["to122"]},"theodora koulouri":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Brunel University"}],"email":"theodora.koulouri@brunel.ac.uk","firstName":"Theodora","lastName":"Koulouri","middleName":"","submissions":["to122"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Describes gender differences in spatial communication and navigation in Human-Robot Interaction.

This paper presents results from a qualitative interview-based study to identify \"coping mechanisms\" that users devise outside explicit boundary-regulation interface features in order to manage interpersonal boundaries. Our categorization of such mechanisms provides insight into interaction design issues and opportunities for new SNS features.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"david wilson":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"}],"email":"davils@uncc.edu","firstName":"David","lastName":"Wilson","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1057"]},"heather lipford":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"}],"email":"richter@uncc.edu","firstName":"Heather","lastName":"Lipford","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1057","paper1713"]},"pamela wisniewski":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte"}],"email":"pjkarr@uncc.edu","firstName":"Pamela","lastName":"Wisniewski","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1057"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"This paper presents results from a qualitative interview-based study to identify \"coping mechanisms\" that Social Networking Site users devise outside explicit boundary-regulation interface features in order to manage interpersonal boundaries.","contactEmail":"pjkarr@uncc.edu","contactFirstName":"Pamela","contactLastName":"Wisniewski","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"paper1057","keywords":["boundary regulation","social networking sites","coping"],"programNumber":"","session":["145"],"title":"Fighting for My Space: Coping Mechanisms for SNS Boundary Regulation","type":"paper"},"paper1695":{"abstract":"Media creation applications cater poorly to one very common usage: Situations in which the users need media that they do not own and for which they are unwilling to pay. Finding and using externally produced media is currently a cumbersome process. Often, users locate the content using a search engine, copy it into their work, cross their fingers, and hope they do not infringe on any copyrights. While the authors have shared hundreds of millions of images with permissive licenses, the license terms are too complicated for other users to follow. In our studies, we found that even the well-intentioned users still fail to respect copyrights in simple image reuse situations. We therefore introduce an Open Media Retrieval (OMR) model to remedy this problem and supplement it with prototypes that access various legal image sources directly within the creative work flow and provide automatic credits to the original authors.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"antti salovaara":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Finland","name":"Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, Espoo"}],"email":"antti.salovaara@hiit.fi","firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Salovaara","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1695"]},"herkko hietanen":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Finland","name":"Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"}],"email":"herkko.hietanen@hiit.fi","firstName":"Herkko","lastName":"Hietanen","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1695"]},"kumaripaba athukorala":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Finland","name":"Helsinki Institute for Information Technology"}],"email":"kumaripaba.athukorala@hiit.fi","firstName":"Kumaripaba","lastName":"Athukorala","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1695"]},"yefeng liu":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Waseda University"}],"email":"yefeng@dcl.info.waseda.ac.jp","firstName":"Yefeng","lastName":"Liu","middleName":"","submissions":["wp199","paper1695"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"We present an Open Media Retrieval model for searching and using Creative Commons content.

We conducted a study where 30 participants completed a simulated holiday booking task; each page showing ads with different degrees of personalization.  Participants fixated twice as long when ads contained their photo.  Participants reported being more likely to notice ads with their photo, holiday destination, and name, but also increasing levels of discomfort with increasing personalization.  We conclude that greater personalization in ad content may achieve higher levels of attention, but that the most personalized ads are also the least acceptable.  The noticeability benefit in using someone's photo to make them look at an ad may be offset by the privacy cost.

The objective was to understand the level of need for website creation by such entrepreneurs for their businesses and further, the challenges associated with website design and maintenance. The study was inspired by the phenomenal uptake of Internet use in the country coupled with a need to explore how micro-entrepreneurs are faring in this space, what potential exists, and how it could be realized. The findings of the study show that the Internet can be the new frontier for many micro-entrepreneurs who want to take their businesses to the next level. The study also provides critical insights into the realities of micro-enterprise, and hence relevant issues to take into consideration in seeking to take micro-enterprise online.  The insights therein cover such issues as affordability of solutions, quick return on investment, convergence of current business methods and practices with those presented by an online environment for greater impact, and need for very simple, intuitive web design tools and platforms. Innovation may be required so as to come up with more website options that are better suited to the needs of micro-entrepreneurs and that are cost-effective. Alternatively other internet-based tools or platforms could be developed to help micro-entrepreneurs conduct business online. This is because the typical websites of today are not necessarily suitable for their needs.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"jussi impio":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Kenya","name":"Nokia Research Center, Africa"}],"email":"jussi.impio@nokia.com","firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Impio","middleName":"","submissions":["cs135","cs158"]},"mokeira masita-mwangi":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Kenya","name":"Nokia Research Center, Africa"}],"email":"mokeira.masita-mwangi@nokia.com","firstName":"Mokeira","lastName":"Masita-Mwangi","middleName":"","submissions":["cs135","cs158"]},"nancy mwakaba":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Kenya","name":"Nokia Research Center"}],"email":"ext-nancy.mwakaba@nokia.com","firstName":"Nancy","lastName":"Mwakaba","middleName":"","submissions":["cs135"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"This paper presents findings, of Kenyan micro-entrepreneurs' need for websites.

If environmental conditions affect perception significantly, then it may not be suitable for mobile interactions. Evaluations were conducted outdoors in varying environmental conditions over a period of 5 months. Results showed that the ambient temperature has a significant impact on people's ability to detect stimuli and also their perception of these stimuli. Humidity has a negligible effect for most humidity values.

To investigate, we conducted in depth interviews with 13 people comparing and contrasting how they think about their possessions, moving from physical ones, to locally kept digital materials, to the online world.

Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average novice user learn to master an interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario? \\  \\ To answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen-gesture-based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao, et al., 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With PapierCraft, people can select sections of printed documents and issue commands such as copy and paste, linking and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of drawing pen gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a Table PC-based interface \\ supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined the application of the command system in active reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in active reading for their combined affordance. In addition, our study reveals some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This paper contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"chunyuan liao":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"FX Palo Alto Laboratory, palo alto, California, United States"}],"email":"liao@fxpal.com","firstName":"Chunyuan","lastName":"Liao","middleName":"","submissions":["to116"]},"fran&#231;ois guimbreti&#232;re":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States"}],"email":"francois@cs.cornell.edu","firstName":"Fran&#231;ois","lastName":"Guimbreti&#232;re","middleName":"","submissions":["to116"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"User studies on a pen-gesture-based interactive paper system for Active Reading.

The framework is then expanded upon to articulate additional areas of undesigning, including self-inhibition, exclusion, removal, replacement, restoration, and safeguarding.

In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"william gaver":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Goldsmiths, University of London"}],"email":"w.gaver@gold.ac.uk","firstName":"William","lastName":"Gaver","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1904","pl120"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"This essay characterises research through design theory as provisional and elaborative, and suggests annotated portfolios as a way forward.

We discuss some of the key analyses of affordances in HCI research and make three related claims. First, we argue that many current interpretations of the concept are essentially incompatible with Gibson. Second, we hold that the Gibsonian concept of affordances, conceptualized as interaction between animals and their environments, provides some important insights, but is, in the end, of limited relevance to HCI research. Third, we call for adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an alternative to Gibson's ecological psychology. We outline a view of technology affordances as possibilities for human action mediated by cultural means conceived as a relational property of a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and environment.

Though in its early deployment stages (2 months), e-ESAS demonstrates the potential to positively impact the cancer care by (1) helping the doctors with graphical charts of long symptom history (automation), (2) facilitating timely interventions through alert generation (automation) and (3) improving three way communications (doctor-patient-attendant) for a better decision making process (motivation) and thereby improving the quality of life of BC patients.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"david roe":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"International Breast Cancer Research Foundation"}],"email":"david.ibcrf@yahoo.com","firstName":"David","lastName":"Roe","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1226"]},"ferdaus kawsar":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Marquette University"}],"email":"ferdaus.kawasr@mu.edu","firstName":"Ferdaus","lastName":"Kawsar","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1226"]},"md haque":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Marquette University"}],"email":"md.haque@mu.edu","firstName":"Md","lastName":"Haque","middleName":"Munirul","submissions":["paper1226"]},"mohammad adibuzzaman":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Marquette University"}],"email":"mohammad.adibuzzaman@mu.edu","firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Adibuzzaman","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1226"]},"reza selim":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Bangladesh","name":"Amader Gram"}],"email":"rezasalim02@yahoo.com","firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Selim","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1226"]},"richard love":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"International Breast Cancer Research Foundation"}],"email":"richard@ibcrf.org","firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Love","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1226"]},"rumana dowla":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Bangladesh","name":"Amader Gram"}],"email":"rumanadowla@yahoo.com","firstName":"Rumana","lastName":"Dowla","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1226"]},"sheikh ahamed":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Marquette University"}],"email":"sheikh.ahamed@mu.edu","firstName":"Sheikh","lastName":"Ahamed","middleName":"Iqbal","submissions":["paper1226"]},"syed hossain":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Bangladesh","name":"Amader Gram"}],"email":"s_m_hossain@yahoo.com","firstName":"Syed","lastName":"Hossain","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1226"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"We present the findings of our 31-week long field study and deployment of e-ESAS - the first mobile-based remote symptom monitoring system developed for rural BC patients.","contactEmail":"sheikh.ahamed@mu.edu","contactFirstName":"Sheikh","contactLastName":"Ahamed","coreCommunities":["user experience"],"featuredCommunities":["health"],"id":"paper1226","keywords":["breast cancer","mobile computing","symptom monitoring",""],"programNumber":"","session":["158"],"title":"Findings of e-ESAS: A Mobile Based Symptom Monitoring System for Breast Cancer Patients in Rural Bangladesh","type":"paper"},"paper1382":{"abstract":"This paper explores some of the problems encountered in using a data archive to build tools for training radiologists to interpret breast screening images.

Using pattern recognition techniques, we built a classifier to recognize unique biometric gesture characteristics of an individual. We achieved a 90% accuracy rate with single gestures, and saw significant improvement when multiple gestures were performed in sequence. We found user ratings of a gestures desirable characteristics (ease, pleasure, excitement) correlated with a gestures actual biometric recognition ratethat is to say, user ratings aligned well with gestural security, in contrast to typical text-based passwords.

The proposed system introduces the visual search capability, and short-term memory effect to the biometric-based security world for the first time. The use of a computer mouse for its dynamics, and as an input sensor for the other two biometrics, means no additional hardware is required than the standard mouse. Experimental evaluation showed the system effectiveness using variable or one-time passwords. All of these attributes qualify the proposed system to be effectively deployed as a static authentication mechanism. \\  \\ Extensive experimentation was done using 2740 sessions collected from 274 users.

Particularly, objects need to be positioned within reach of users, need to be orientated properly, and need to be scaled appropriately for convenient interaction by touch. As the user&#8217;s location at the device is usually unknown to the system, objects are typically spawned at a default position and with a default orientation  and size in tabletop user interfaces. Thus, users typically need to manipulate objects after instantiation until they are properly aligned and scaled, which can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. We designed two gesture-based interaction techniques to instantiate objects with a convenient orientation, size, and position, making further adjustments to these properties unnecessary. We describe the functionality of both techniques and discuss insights gathered during initial evaluations.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"benjamin poppinga":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"OFFIS Institute for Information Technology"}],"email":"benjamin.poppinga@offis.de","firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Poppinga","middleName":"","submissions":["paper538","wp159"]},"susanne boll":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"University of Oldenburg"}],"email":"susanne.boll@informatik.uni-oldenburg.de","firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Boll","middleName":"","submissions":["paper538","paper449","wp159"]},"tobias hesselmann":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"OFFIS Institute for Information Technology"}],"email":"tobias.hesselmann@offis.de","firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Hesselmann","middleName":"","submissions":["wp159"]},"volker goll&#252;cke":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"University of Oldenburg"}],"email":"volker.golluecke@uni-oldenburg.de","firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Goll&#252;cke","middleName":"","submissions":["wp159"]},"wilko heuten":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"OFFIS Institute for Information Technology, Oldenburg, Lower Saxony"}],"email":"heuten@offis.de","firstName":"Wilko","lastName":"Heuten","middleName":"","submissions":["paper538","wp159"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"tobias.hesselmann@offis.de","contactFirstName":"Tobias","contactLastName":"Hesselmann","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp159","keywords":["interactive tabletops and surfaces","containers","scaling","orientation","positioning"],"programNumber":"209","session":["229"],"title":"Drawing Shapes and Lines: Spawning Objects on Interactive Tabletops","type":"wp"},"wp165":{"abstract":"System evaluators face several challenges in designing evaluation methods, including measurement and relevance, context, establishing common ground with users, and eliciting users&#8217; tacit knowledge.

Literature study is a cycle of reading, interpretation, exploration, and understanding. While there is now abundant technological support for reading and interpreting literary text in new ways through text-processing algorithms, the other parts of the cycle -- exploration and understanding -- have been relatively neglected. Motivated by the literature on sensemaking, we are developing a software system  that integrates tools for algorithmic processing of text with interaction techniques that support the interpretive, exploratory, and note-taking aspects of scholarship. At present, our project supports grammatical search and contextual similarity determination, visualization of patterns of word context, and examination and organization of the source material for comparison and hypothesis-building. This article illustrates its capabilities by analyzing language-use differences between male and female characters in Shakespeare's plays. We find that when love is a major plot point, the language Shakespeare uses to refer to women becomes more physical, and the language referring to men becomes more sentimental. Future work will incorporate additional sensemaking tools  to aid comparison,  exploration, grouping, and pattern recognition.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"aditi muralidharan":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"aditi@cs.berkeley.edu","firstName":"Aditi","lastName":"Muralidharan","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1880","wp211"]},"marti a. hearst":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California Berkeley"}],"email":"hearst@ischool.berkeley.edu","firstName":"Marti A.","lastName":"Hearst","middleName":"","submissions":["wp211"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"aditi.shrikumar@gmail.com","contactFirstName":"Aditi","contactLastName":"Muralidharan","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp211","keywords":["sensemaking","user interfaces","visualization","text analysis","information retrieval"],"programNumber":"229","session":["229"],"title":"A Sensemaking Environment for Literary Text","type":"wp"},"wp217":{"abstract":"This study explored whether cues from others in a purchase environment have an effect on purchase behavior for products with fair-trade labels, an ethical attribute of products, among Japanese consumers.

The results show that participants can input at accuracy of 94% for five different pressure levels with minimal error.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"kwang-yun wohn":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Korea, Republic of","name":"KAIST"}],"email":"wohn@kaist.ac.kr","firstName":"Kwang-yun","lastName":"Wohn","middleName":"","submissions":["wp234"]},"sungjae hwang":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Korea, Republic of","name":"KAIST"}],"email":"best@kaist.ac.kr","firstName":"Sungjae","lastName":"Hwang","middleName":"","submissions":["wp232","wp234"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"best@kaist.ac.kr","contactFirstName":"Sungjae","contactLastName":"Hwang","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp234","keywords":["pseudo interface","pseudo modality","sonic interaction","acoustic sound","pressure sensitive input"],"programNumber":"115","session":["229"],"title":"PseudoButton: Enabling Pressure-Sensitive Interaction by Repurposing Microphone on Mobile Device","type":"wp"},"wp236":{"abstract":"In the 21st century knowledge economy there is a growing need for the types of creative thinkers who can bridge the engineering mindset with the creative mindset, combining multiple types of skills. New economies will need workers who have \"diagonal\" skill sets, who can develop systems and content as an integrative process. This requires a new type of training and curriculum. In the newly formed \"Digital Culture\" undergraduate program at ASU, we attempt to support new types curricula by structuring differently the way students move through courses. With a constantly shifting and changing curriculum, structuring course enrollment using class &#8220;prerequisites&#8221; leads to fixed and rigid pathways through the curriculum. Instead, Digital Culture structures course sequences based on the students accumulation of abstract \"Proficiencies\" which are collected by students as they complete courses, and which act as keys to unlock access to higher level course. As a student accumulates more and more of these proficiencies, they are increasingly able to unlock new courses. This system leads to more flexible and adaptive pathways through courses while ensuring that students are prepared for entrance into more advanced classes. It is however more complicated and requires that students strategically plan their route through the curriculum. In order to support this kind of strategic planning we have designed and deployed a course planning system where students can simulate various possible paths through the curriculum. In this paper, we show our design process in coming up with our \"Digital Culture Visual Planner\". This design process starts with a network analysis of how all the Digital Culture courses are interrelated by, visualizing the relationships between &#8220;proficiencies&#8221; and courses. A number of possible design directions result from this analysis. Finally we select a single design and refine it to be understandable, useful and usable by new undergraduate Digital Culture majors.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"david tinapple":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Arizona State University, Tempe, USA, Tempe, Arizona, United States"}],"email":"dtinappl@asu.edu","firstName":"David","lastName":"Tinapple","middleName":"","submissions":["wp236"]},"hari sundaram":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Arizona State University"}],"email":"hari.sundaram@asu.edu","firstName":"Hari","lastName":"Sundaram","middleName":"","submissions":["wp296","wp236"]},"zhen li":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Arizona State University"}],"email":"li.zhen@asu.edu","firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Li","middleName":"","submissions":["wp236"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"li.zhen@asu.edu","contactFirstName":"Zhen","contactLastName":"Li","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp236","keywords":["design","web-based interaction","education"],"programNumber":"123","session":["229"],"title":"Visual Planner: Beyond Prerequisites, Designing an Interactive Course Planner for a 21st Century Flexible Curriculum","type":"wp"},"wp237":{"abstract":"Today&#8217;s in-car information systems are undergoing an evolution towards device miniaturization as well as to real-time telematics services.

We conducted an online study (N = 401) to uncover the impact of recent changes in the underlying social and technological landscape on the preferences and practices of LSS users in the US. We found that the main motivations for location sharing were to connect with one's social circle, to project an interesting image of oneself, and to receive rewards offered for \"checking in.\" Respondents overwhelmingly preferred sharing location only upon explicit action. More than 25% of the respondents recalled at least one instance of regret over having shared location. These findings highlight the tension between the utility of location sharing and concerns with invasions of privacy. Empowering users to resolve this tension effectively can potentially drive further growth in adoption and utility of LSS.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"adam lee":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Pittsburgh"}],"email":"adamlee@cs.pitt.edu","firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Lee","middleName":"J.","submissions":["wp241"]},"apu kapadia":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Indiana University, Bloomington"}],"email":"kapadia@indiana.edu","firstName":"Apu","lastName":"Kapadia","middleName":"","submissions":["wp241"]},"gregory norcie":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Indiana University, Bloomington, Bloomington"}],"email":"gnorcie@indiana.edu","firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Norcie","middleName":"","submissions":["wp241"]},"sameer patil":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Indiana University"}],"email":"patil@indiana.edu","firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Patil","middleName":"","submissions":["wp241"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"patil@indiana.edu","contactFirstName":"Sameer","contactLastName":"Patil","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp241","keywords":["location sharing services","privacy","check-in"],"programNumber":"236","session":["229"],"title":"\"Check out where I am!\": Location-Sharing Motivations, Preferences, and Practices","type":"wp"},"wp245":{"abstract":"Cooking together is an important part of everyday life, a social event in which people enhance their relationships through shared stories and swapping ideas on food preparation.

We implemented a prototype and conducted a user study with five participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the system.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"aya ikeda":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Ochanomizu University"}],"email":"ikeda.aya@is.ocha.ac.jp","firstName":"Aya","lastName":"Ikeda","middleName":"","submissions":["wp310"]},"itiro siio":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Ochanomizu University"}],"email":"siio@acm.org","firstName":"Itiro","lastName":"Siio","middleName":"","submissions":["wp310","wp222"]},"toshifumi arai":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Citizen Holdings Co.,Ltd."}],"email":"toshifumi@acm.org","firstName":"Toshifumi","lastName":"Arai","middleName":"","submissions":["wp310"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"ikeda.aya@is.ocha.ac.jp","contactFirstName":"Aya","contactLastName":"Ikeda","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp310","keywords":["sleep","memory","learning","study","android application","google app engine","dream drill"],"programNumber":"212","session":["229"],"title":"Dream Drill: Learning Application","type":"wp"},"wp313":{"abstract":"Social media and online communication encourage social interaction but do little to strengthen community relations between people who live in the same area.

While beyond-surface sketching actively takes place in diverse forms and in various activities, directly applying existing on-surface sketch recognition techniques beyond physical surfaces is far from trivial.  In this paper, we investigate initial approaches for locating corners and extracting primitive geometric shapes in beyond-surface sketches, which are important ingredients of subsequent higher-level interpretations for building richer sketching interfaces.  Moreover, we investigate preliminary challenges of sketch recognition in beyond-surface environments and discuss possible solutions for achieving successful next-step extensions of this work.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"paul taele":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU)"}],"email":"ptaele@cse.tamu.edu","firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Taele","middleName":"","submissions":["wp314"]},"tracy hammond":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Texas A&amp;M University"}],"email":"hammond@cs.tamu.edu","firstName":"Tracy","lastName":"Hammond","middleName":"","submissions":["wp582","wp314","cs191","wp507"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"ptaele@cse.tamu.edu","contactFirstName":"Paul","contactLastName":"Taele","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp314","keywords":["sketch recognition","low-level processing","beyond-surface interactions"],"programNumber":"243","session":["229"],"title":"Initial Approaches for Extending Sketch Recognition to Beyond-Surface Environments","type":"wp"},"wp316":{"abstract":"A preliminary analysis of diary study of cell phone use in the home shows that mobility is an important feature at home and phones are more mobile than laptop computers with wifi.

To alleviate this problem, we present a way to systematically derive trust-supporting design elements using trust theory. Using a laboratory experiment, we show that the trust-related design elements derived from theory are regarded as being important by the participants, and significantly increased their trust in a restaurant recommendation system as well as in their intention to use it in the future.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"axel hoffmann":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Kassel University"}],"email":"axel.hoffmann@uni-kassel.de","firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Hoffmann","middleName":"","submissions":["wp332"]},"holger hoffmann":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Kassel University"}],"email":"holger.hoffmann@uni-kassel.de","firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Hoffmann","middleName":"","submissions":["wp332"]},"jan marco leimeister":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Kassel University"}],"email":"leimeister@uni-kassel.de","firstName":"Jan Marco","lastName":"Leimeister","middleName":"","submissions":["wp332","wp472","wp420"]},"matthias s&#246;llner":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Kassel University"}],"email":"soellner@uni-kassel.de","firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"S&#246;llner","middleName":"","submissions":["wp332"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"soellner@wi-kassel.de","contactFirstName":"Matthias","contactLastName":"S\u00f6llner","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp332","keywords":["theory","trust","technology acceptance and usage","system design","laboratory experiment"],"programNumber":"138","session":["229"],"title":"How to Use Behavioral Research Insights on Trust for HCI System Design","type":"wp"},"wp335":{"abstract":"We present research that investigates the amount of guidance required by users for precise back-of-device interaction.

We then propose that future work should focus on optimizing this combined method through sequencing, so that one evaluation approach would inform the design of subsequently used ones.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"christopher jewell":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Microsoft"}],"email":"cjewell@microsoft.com","firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Jewell","middleName":"","submissions":["wp557"]},"franco salvetti":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Microsoft"}],"email":"francosa@microsoft.com","firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Salvetti","middleName":"","submissions":["wp557"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":null,"contactEmail":"cjewell@microsoft.com","contactFirstName":"Christopher","contactLastName":"Jewell","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"wp557","keywords":["usability research","remote testing","evaluation","web usability","web-based testing"],"programNumber":"214","session":["229"],"title":"Towards a Combined Method of Web Usability Testing:  An Assessment of the Complementary Advantages of Lab Testing, Pre-Session Assignments, and Online Usability Services","type":"wp"},"wp563":{"abstract":"The purpose of this study is to better understand users&#8217; multitasking behavior patterns and to extract design implications based on user experience and user testing evaluation.

Results suggest that when individuals are co-located, their search behaviors tend to overlap thus affecting their ability to find diverse and useful information. On the other hand, when people are remotely located, the levels of independency and diversity depend upon the richness of the communication channel being used. Finally, when collaborative search is performed asynchronously, team members reach high levels of independency at the cost of effectiveness.

The visualization of such gameplay data is essentially an information visualization problem, where a large number of variables have to be displayed in a comprehensible way in order to be able to make global judgments.

It visualizes the game space as a set of nodes which players visit over the course of a game and is also suitable to observe time-dependent information, such as player distribution.

Prior work has noted challenges in justifying them to developers. In contrast, it has been assumed that designers and user experience professionals--whose goal is to focus designs on targeted users--will readily exploit personas. This paper examines that assumption. We present the first study of how experienced user-centered design (UCD) practitioners with prior experience deploying personas, use and perceive personas in industrial software design. We identify limits to the persona approach in the context studied. Practitioners used personas almost exclusively for communication, but not for design. Participants identified four problems with personas, finding them abstract, impersonal, misleading and distracting. Our findings argue for a new approach to persona deployment and construction. Personas cannot replace immersion in actual user data. And rather than focusing on creating engaging personas, it is critical to avoid persona attributes that mislead or distract.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"steve whittaker":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California at Santa Cruz"}],"email":"stevejohnwhittaker@googlemail.com","firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Whittaker","middleName":"","submissions":["paper572","paper1825","paper1688"]},"tara matthews":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"IBM Research - Almaden"}],"email":"tlmatthe@us.ibm.com","firstName":"Tara","lastName":"Matthews","middleName":"","submissions":["paper804","paper1825","paper1688"]},"tejinder judge":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Google Inc."}],"email":"tejinderjudge@google.com","firstName":"Tejinder","lastName":"Judge","middleName":"K.","submissions":["paper1825","paper1688"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Qualitative study of how experienced user-centered design practitioners perceive and use personas for industrial software design.

For low-income children in developing countries, this task can be significantly more challenging because of lack of access to high-quality schooling, but can potentially improve economic prospects at the same time. A synthesis of research findings suggests that practicing recalling and vocalizing words for expressing an intended meaning could improve word reading skills &#8211; including reading in a second language &#8211; more than silent recognition of what the given words mean. Unfortunately, many language learning software do not support this instructional approach, owing to the technical challenges of incorporating speech recognition support to check that the learner is vocalizing the correct word. In this paper, we present results from a usability test and two subsequent experiments that explore the use of two speech recognition-enabled mobile games to help rural children in India read words with understanding.

The designs on the cards were deliberately provocative and aimed to encourage criticism and debate. Participants wrote and drew on the cards and the workshops were recorded and transcribed. The participants were extremely critical of current banking practices and most of the new concepts we presented to them. Their questions and comments led to a number of insights and further iterations.

However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the Kinect sensor's low image resolution. A comprehensive repertoire of 3D manipulation operations is proposed to manipulate single objects, perform fast constrained rotation, and pack/align multiple objects along a line. Three user studies were devised to demonstrate the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed interaction techniques on different virtual manipulation scenarios.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"chi-wing fu":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Singapore","name":"Nanyang Technological University"}],"email":"cwfu@ntu.edu.sg","firstName":"Chi-Wing","lastName":"Fu","middleName":"","submissions":["in259","paper131"]},"peng song":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Singapore","name":"Nanyang Technological University"}],"email":"song0083@e.ntu.edu.sg","firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Song","middleName":"","submissions":["in259","paper131"]},"william hutama":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Singapore","name":"Nanyang Technological University"}],"email":"hwilliam@ntu.edu.sg","firstName":"William","lastName":"Hutama","middleName":"","submissions":["in259","paper131"]},"wooi boon goh":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Singapore","name":"Nanyang Technological University"}],"email":"aswbgoh@ntu.edu.sg","firstName":"Wooi Boon","lastName":"Goh","middleName":"","submissions":["al104","in259","paper131"]},"xiaopei liu":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Singapore","name":"Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"}],"email":"liuxp@ntu.edu.sg","firstName":"Xiaopei","lastName":"Liu","middleName":"","submissions":["in259","paper131"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed to realise a suite of intuitive and highly-controllable mid-air interaction for manipulating single/multiple virtual 3D objects with low-resolution depth sensors like Kinect ","contactEmail":"cwfu@ntu.edu.sg","contactFirstName":"Chi-Wing","contactLastName":"Fu","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"paper131","keywords":["3d manipulation","bimanual gestures","user interaction"],"programNumber":"","session":["142"],"title":"A Handle Bar Metaphor for Virtual Object Manipulation with Mid-Air Interaction","type":"paper"},"paper1621":{"abstract":"Lightweight spatially aware displays (Tangible Magic Lenses) are an effective approach for exploring complex information spaces within a tabletop environment.

Finger drawn gestures tended to be larger and faster than pen drawn gestures. They also differed in shape geometry as measured by, for example, aperture of closed gestures, corner shape distance and intersecting points deviation; (2) Pen drawn gestures and finger drawn gestures were similar in several measures including articulation time, indicative angle difference, axial symmetry and proportional shape distance; (3) There were interaction effects between gesture implement (finger vs. pen) and target gesture size and gesture complexity. Our findings show that half of the features we tested were performed well enough by the finger.

While discrete foot-based input has relatively few parameters to control, continuous input requires careful design considerations on how the user's input can be mapped to a control parameter (e.g. the volume knob of the media player). We investigate this issue further through three user-studies.

While users are interacting with the table, our system Bootstrapper observes their shoes using one or more depth cameras mounted to the edge of the table. It then identifies users by matching camera images with a database of known shoe images. When multiple users interact, Bootstrapper associates touches with shoes based on hand orientation. The approach can be implemented using consumer depth cameras because (1) shoes offer large distinct features such as color, (2) shoes naturally align themselves with the ground, giving the system a well-defined perspective and thus reduced ambiguity. We report two simple studies in which Bootstrapper recognized participants from a database of 18 users with 95.8% accuracy.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"christian holz":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Hasso Plattner Institute"}],"email":"christian.holz@hpi.uni-potsdam.de","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Holz","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1064","paper2022"]},"patrick baudisch":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Hasso Plattner Institute"}],"email":"patrick.baudisch@hpi.uni-potsdam.de","firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Baudisch","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1064","paper1067","in121","paper718","paper1070"]},"stephan richter":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Hasso Plattner Institute"}],"email":"stephan.richter@student.hpi.uni-potsdam.de","firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Richter","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1064"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Reformulating the user recognition problem as a shoe recognition problem and present a prototype that recognizes tabletop users.","contactEmail":"patrick.baudisch@hpi.uni-potsdam.de","contactFirstName":"Patrick","contactLastName":"Baudisch","coreCommunities":["engineering"],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"paper1064","keywords":["tabletop systems","user identification","indoor tracking","touch","personalization","microsoft surface"],"programNumber":"","session":["141"],"title":"Bootstrapper: Recognizing Tabletop Users by their Shoes","type":"paper"},"paper463":{"abstract":"When the user is engaged with a real-world task it can be inappropriate or difficult to use a smartphone.

In large and small environments translational body-based information significantly improved the accuracy of participants&#8217; cognitive maps, measured using estimates of direction and relative straight line distance but, on its own, rotational body-based information had no effect. In environments of small extent, full body-based information also improved participants&#8217; navigational performance.

The social nature of watching video and television drives developers of both types of applications to explore the integration of successful social media like Facebook or Twitter with streaming video. Moreover, several apps are being created for smartphones and tablets, which act as a second screen that allows remotely communicating with friends while watching. These types of applications can be called social TV, allowing remote viewers to interact with each other via the television set, smartphones, tablets or the PC. Features include remote talking or chatting while watching television, sending recommendations, leaving comments, showing what you watch or sharing video clips. \\  \\ This course studies current developments on social television and online video applications, providing participants first hand knowledge on how to analyze, design and evaluate them. The term &#8216;sociability&#8217; is used to indicate these interface aspects that support and enhance social interaction with and through new technologies and applications, and social interaction design is a way of including these sociability aspects in the design process. The specific nature of social video watching, such as enjoying a television program while communicating or using television content as conversation starter, warrant the use of a specific design process and guidelines, focusing on social interaction and sociability. \\  \\ During the course, participants will learn in a very practical way how to design and evaluate social features of these emergent applications.

With the proliferation of mobile devices capable of supporting significantly complex applications on small screens, demands on mobile UI design and the user&#65533;s visual system are becoming greater. In this paper, we report results from an empirical study of human visual attention, specifically the Change Blindness phenomenon, on handheld mobile devices and its impact on mobile UI design. It is arguable that due to the small size of the screen - unlike a typical computer monitor - a greater visual coverage of the mobile device is possible, and that these phenomena may occur less frequently during the use of the device, or even that they may not occur at all. Our study shows otherwise. \\  \\ We tested for Change Blindness (CB) and Inattentional Blindness (IB) in a single-modal, mobile context and attempted to establish factors in the application interface design that induce and/or reduce their occurrences. The results show that both CB and IB can and do occur while using mobile devices. The results also suggest that the number of separate attendable items on-screen is directly proportional to rates of CB. Newly inserted objects were correctly identified more often than changes applied to existing on-screen objects. These results suggest that it is important for mobile UI designers to take these aspects of visual attention into account when designing mobile applications that attempt to deliver information through visual changes or notifications.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"ashweeni beeharee":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University College London"}],"email":"A.Beeharee@cs.ucl.ac.uk","firstName":"Ashweeni","lastName":"Beeharee","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1525"]},"thomas davies":{"affiliations":[{"country":"London","name":"University College London"}],"email":"czulu007@googlemail.com","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Davies","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1525"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Presents evidence that change blindness occurs on small displays and is affected by interface designs.

However, the conventional visual representations that are incorporated in many learning technologies tend to direct learners to overestimate the sizes of imperceptible objects. To address this issue, we designed a multimodal representation called &#8220;temporal-aural-visual representation (or TAVR) to provide students with an alternative way of perceiving and conceptualizing imperceptible sizes. In prior studies it was noticed that learners constructed more refined mental models of the vast range of imperceptible sizes through the TAVR-enhanced learning activity.

We varied the algorithms based on scent type supported (words alone vs. words + code structure), and based on use of foraging momentum to estimate rapidity of foragers' goal changes. Our empirical results showed that (1) using both words and code structure significantly improved the ability of the algorithms to recommend where software developers should look for information; (2) participants used recommendations to discover new places in the code and also as shortcuts to navigate to known places; and (3) low-momentum recommendations were significantly more useful than high-momentum recommendations, suggesting rapid and numerous goal changes in this type of setting.

However, conceptual tools for understanding how people relate to the audiences they reach through these systems are limited. The increasing interest in user-generated content in HCI demands the infusion of new methods and theories that explicitly engage the construction and use of media within and among large groups of individuals and systems. In this paper, we suggest that the notion of &#8220;publics,&#8221; drawn from media theory, provides useful insights into user-driven, social, and cultural forms of technology use and digital content creation. We illustrate this by employing the notion of publics to the findings from a two-month deployment of a mobile photo sharing platform in a youth housing community. The results of this empirical work coupled with a theoretical examination of publics stimulate reflection on prevailing interpretations of user-designer-reader roles. The paper provides an outlook for potentially new and productive ways of understanding interdependencies within those activities.

It takes a look at education challenges faced by African youth and the gaps that exist in the education systems. African youth have the potential to be frontrunners in socio-economic transformation in the continent. They need to be empowered to be able to play their part. The huge gaps between education policy and practice, and other problems in this sector leave many African youth out of the system. Information and communication technology (ICT) is being integrated in education in many African countries. The emphasis has been on equipping schools with computers and literacy of the same. However the progress and impact is minimal due to inadequate resources, infrastructural challenges and lack of capacity. Mobile phone penetration in the continent has increased phenomenally unlike ownership of personal computers. This paper therefore proposes m-learning using mobile phones as a logical and viable channel of delivering education to African youth.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"faith ronoh-boreh":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Kenya","name":"Nokia Research Center, Africa"}],"email":"ext-faith.ronoh-boreh@nokia.com","firstName":"Faith","lastName":"Ronoh-Boreh","middleName":"","submissions":["cs158"]},"jussi impio":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Kenya","name":"Nokia Research Center, Africa"}],"email":"jussi.impio@nokia.com","firstName":"Jussi","lastName":"Impio","middleName":"","submissions":["cs135","cs158"]},"mokeira masita-mwangi":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Kenya","name":"Nokia Research Center, Africa"}],"email":"mokeira.masita-mwangi@nokia.com","firstName":"Mokeira","lastName":"Masita-Mwangi","middleName":"","submissions":["cs135","cs158"]},"nancy mwakaba":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Kenya","name":"none"}],"email":"ext-nancy.mwakaba@nokia.com","firstName":"Nancy","lastName":"Mwakaba","middleName":"","submissions":["cs158"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"The paper provides valuable insights into African youth in terms of education challenges and opportunities hence inspiring and informing research and development of technologies for Africa particularly for m-learning.","contactEmail":"mokeira.masita-mwangi@nokia.com","contactFirstName":"Mokeira","contactLastName":"Masita-Mwangi","coreCommunities":["design"],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"cs158","keywords":["youth","education","e-learning","m-learning"],"programNumber":"","session":["156"],"title":"Building a Case for M-learning in Africa: African Youth Perspectives on Education","type":"cs"},"paper1608":{"abstract":"An essential aspect of learning a second language is the acquisition of vocabulary.

However, studies on the effectiveness of tutor software have been conducted mainly in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, and little is known about how these systems might be used in other contexts with differing classroom practices and values. To understand this question, we studied the usage of mathematics tutoring software for middle school at sites in three Latin American countries: Brazil, Mexico, and Costa Rica. While cognitive tutors were designed for individual use, we found that students in these classrooms worked collaboratively, engaging in interdependently paced work and conducting work away from their own computer.

For blind people handwriting is very difficult to learn as it is a near-zero feedback activity that is needed only occasionally, yet in important situations; for example to make an attractive and repeatable signature for legal contracts. McSig aids the teaching of signatures by translating digital ink from the teacher&#8217;s stylus gestures into three non-visual forms: (1) audio pan and pitch represents the x and y movement of the stylus; (2) kinaesthetic information is provided to the student through a force-feedback haptic pen which mimics the teacher&#8217;s stylus movement; (3) a physical tactile line on the writing sheet is created by the haptic pen.  \\ McSig has been developed over two major iterations of design, usability testing and evaluation. The final step of the first iteration was a short evaluation with eight visually impaired children. The results suggested that McSig had the highest potential benefit for congenitally and totally blind children and also indicated some areas where McSig could be enhanced. The second prototype incorporated significant modifications to the system, improving the audio, tactile and force-feedback. We then ran a detailed, longitudinal evaluation over 14 weeks with three of the congenitally blind children to assess McSig&#8217;s effectiveness in teaching the creation of signatures. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of McSig &#8211; they all made considerable progress in learning to create a recognizable signature. By the end of ten lessons two of the children could form a complete, repeatable signature unaided, the third could do so with a little verbal prompting. Furthermore, during this project we have learnt valuable lessons about providing consistent feedback between different communications channels (by manual interactions, haptic device, pen correction) that will be of interest to others developing multimodal systems. \\","acmLink":null,"authors":{"andrew crossan":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Glasgow"}],"email":"ac@dcs.gla.ac.uk","firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Crossan","middleName":"","submissions":["to108"]},"beryl plimmer":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"}],"email":"beryl@cs.auckland.ac.nz","firstName":"Beryl","lastName":"Plimmer","middleName":"","submissions":["to108"]},"peter reid":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Auckland"}],"email":"petereidnz@gmail.com","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Reid","middleName":"","submissions":["to108"]},"rachel blagojevic":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Auckland"}],"email":"rpat088@aucklanduni.ac.nz","firstName":"Rachel","lastName":"Blagojevic","middleName":"","submissions":["to108"]},"stephen brewster":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom"}],"email":"stephen@dcs.gla.ac.uk","firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Brewster","middleName":"","submissions":["to108"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"McSig is a multimodal system for teaching blind children to write and draw.

We investigate the potential of communitysourcing by designing, implementing and evaluating Umati: the communitysourcing vending machine. Umati allows users to earn credits by performing tasks using a touchscreen attached to the machine. Physical rewards (in this case, snacks) are dispensed through traditional vending mechanics. We evaluated whether communitysourcing can accomplish expert work by using Umati to grade Computer Science exams. We placed Umati in a university Computer Science building, targeting students with grading tasks for snacks. Over one week, 328 unique users (302 of whom were students) completed 7771 tasks (7240 by students). 80% of users had never participated in a crowdsourcing market before. We found that Umati was able to grade exams with 2% higher accuracy (at the same price) or at 33% lower cost (at equivalent accuracy) than traditional single-expert grading. Mechanical Turk workers had no success grading the same exams. These results indicate that communitysourcing can successfully elicit high-quality expert work from specific communities.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"bj&#246;rn hartmann":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"bjoern@eecs.berkeley.edu","firstName":"Bj&#246;rn","lastName":"Hartmann","middleName":"","submissions":["in127","paper379","wp345","paper423"]},"brian gawalt":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"gawalt@eecs.berkeley.edu","firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Gawalt","middleName":"","submissions":["in127","paper379"]},"kuang chen":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"kuangc@eecs.berkeley.edu","firstName":"Kuang","lastName":"Chen","middleName":"","submissions":["paper379"]},"kurtis heimerl":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"kheimerl@cs.berkeley.edu","firstName":"Kurtis","lastName":"Heimerl","middleName":"","submissions":["in127","paper379"]},"tapan parikh":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Berkeley"}],"email":"parikh@berkeley.edu","firstName":"Tapan","lastName":"Parikh","middleName":"S","submissions":["in127","paper379"]}},"bestPaperAward":true,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Introduces communitysourcing: the use of physical kiosks to target existing crowds of expert workers with specific large-volume microtasks.

We present the game Hit It! that has been installed 427,255 times and, more importantly, served as a tool to conduct a number of HCI studies. The amount of collected data enabled us to study users' touch behaviour, approaches to ask for consent, the best time to deploy games, and approaches for providing tactile feedback.

Deploying high-fidelity simulations is expensive and dangerous; they do not address team coordination. Low-fidelity approaches are ineffective because they are not stressful. \\  \\ Zero-fidelity simulation develops and invokes the principle of abstraction, focusing on human-information and human-human transfers of meaning, to derive design from work practice. Our principal hypothesis is that crisis responders will experience zero-fidelity simulation as effective simulation of team coordination.

To address this concern, we developed ShoeSense, a wearable system consisting in part of a shoe-mounted depth sensor pointing upward at the wearer. ShoeSense recognizes relaxed and discreet as well as large and demonstrative hand gestures. In particular, we designed three gesture sets (Triangle, Radial, and Finger-Count) for this setup, which can be performed without visual attention. The advantages of ShoeSense are illustrated in five scenarios: (1) quickly performing frequent operations without reaching for the phone, (2) discreetly performing operations without disturbing others, (3) enhancing operations on mobile devices, (4) supporting accessibility, and (5) artistic performances. We present a proof-of-concept, wearable implementation based on a depth camera and report on a lab study comparing social acceptability, physical and mental demand, and user preference.

The haptic engine extracts events from the game, assigns haptic feedback to these events, and sends coded packets to haptic API/codec. The haptic API/codec translates the coded packets and computes driving signals based on carefully evaluated algorithms derived from psychophysical modeling of tactile perception. The driving signals are then routed to the haptic display embedded with an array of vibratory transducers. A user feels high resolution and refined tactile sensations on the body through the display.

We have a field test by using TEROOS and observed that the wearable avatar innovatively assisted the users to communicate during their joint activities such as route navigating and buying goods at a shop. The user controlling TEROOS could give the user wearing it appropriate route instructions on the basis of the situation around TEROOS. In addition, both users could easily identify objects that they discussed. Moreover, shop staff members communicated with the user controlling TEROOS and behaved as they normally would when the user asked questions about the goods.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"hirotaka osawa":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"osawa@ayu.ics.keio.ac.jp","firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Osawa","middleName":"","submissions":["paper120","in114","vi135","in190"]},"kazuhiko shinozawa":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"ATR Intelligent Robotics and Communication Laboratories"}],"email":"shino@atr.co.jp","firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Shinozawa","middleName":"","submissions":["paper120","vi135","in190"]},"michita imai":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"michita@ayu.ics.keio.ac.jp","firstName":"Michita","lastName":"Imai","middleName":"","submissions":["paper120","in114","vi135","in190"]},"tadakazu kashiwabara":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"kashi@ayu.ics.keio.ac.jp","firstName":"Tadakazu","lastName":"Kashiwabara","middleName":"","submissions":["paper120","vi135","in190"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"The note describes what communication style a wearable robot avatar offers to daily life situations.

The social nature of watching video and television drives developers of both types of applications to explore the integration of successful social media like Facebook or Twitter with streaming video. Moreover, several apps are being created for smartphones and tablets, which act as a second screen that allows remotely communicating with friends while watching. These types of applications can be called social TV, allowing remote viewers to interact with each other via the television set, smartphones, tablets or the PC. Features include remote talking or chatting while watching television, sending recommendations, leaving comments, showing what you watch or sharing video clips. \\  \\ This course studies current developments on social television and online video applications, providing participants first hand knowledge on how to analyze, design and evaluate them. The term &#8216;sociability&#8217; is used to indicate these interface aspects that support and enhance social interaction with and through new technologies and applications, and social interaction design is a way of including these sociability aspects in the design process. The specific nature of social video watching, such as enjoying a television program while communicating or using television content as conversation starter, warrant the use of a specific design process and guidelines, focusing on social interaction and sociability. \\  \\ During the course, participants will learn in a very practical way how to design and evaluate social features of these emergent applications. Based on their extensive experience in designing and performing user tests of social television, and using real world examples, the instructors will explain the practical issues and will highlight key challenges for the CHI community.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"david geerts":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Belgium","name":"KU Leuven"}],"email":"david.geerts@soc.kuleuven.be","firstName":"David","lastName":"Geerts","middleName":"","submissions":["cr132"]},"pablo cesar":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Netherlands","name":"CWI (Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica)"}],"email":"p.s.cesar@cwi.nl","firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Cesar","middleName":"","submissions":["cr132"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Will teach you how to analyze, design and evaluate social interaction for online video and television, giving practical tools, techniques and guidelines to apply directly in your own work.","contactEmail":"david.geerts@soc.kuleuven.be","contactFirstName":"David","contactLastName":"Geerts","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"cr132","keywords":[],"programNumber":"18","session":["81","82"],"title":"Course 18: Social Interaction Design for Online Video and Television","type":"cr"}},"time":"16:30","title":"Course 18: Social Interaction Design for Online Video and Television","type":"Course"}},"13B":{"75":{"chairAffiliations":"","chairs":["Aaron Houssian","Pieter Jan Stappers"],"coreCommunities":["design"],"date":"May 8, 2012","endTime":"17:50","featuredCommunities":[],"hasAward":false,"hasHonorableMention":false,"id":"75","notes":"Part 1 is on Monday at the same time slot.

Currently, there are several interactions, such as letting the user control the toy remotely, or inputting the desired movement by moving the toy, and having the data recorded and played back.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"anusha withana":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"anusha@kmd.keio.ac.jp","firstName":"Anusha","lastName":"Withana","middleName":"","submissions":["in207","paper373","vi139"]},"calista lee":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"calistalxy@gmail.com","firstName":"Calista","lastName":"Lee","middleName":"","submissions":["in207","paper373","vi139"]},"daisuke sakamoto":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"The University of Tokyo"}],"email":"d.sakamoto@gmail.com","firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Sakamoto","middleName":"","submissions":["in207","paper373","vi139"]},"masahiko inami":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"inami@inami.info","firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Inami","middleName":"","submissions":["in207","paper373","vi139"]},"masayasu ogata":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"ogatite@gmail.com","firstName":"Masayasu","lastName":"Ogata","middleName":"","submissions":["in114","in207","paper373","vi139"]},"takeo igarashi":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"The University of Tokyo"}],"email":"takeo@acm.org","firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Igarashi","middleName":"","submissions":["in207","paper373","in163","vi139"]},"yasutoshi makino":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"makino@sdm.keio.ac.jp","firstName":"Yasutoshi","lastName":"Makino","middleName":"","submissions":["in207","paper373","vi139"]},"yuta sugiura":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"yuta.sugiura@gmail.com","firstName":"Yuta","lastName":"Sugiura","middleName":"","submissions":["in114","in207","paper373","vi139"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"PINOKY is a wireless ring-like device that can be externally attached to any plush toy as an accessory that animates the toy by moving its limbs.","contactEmail":"yuta.sugiura@gmail.com","contactFirstName":"Yuta","contactLastName":"Sugiura","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"vi139","keywords":["interactive plush toy","tangible user interface","robots","ubiquitous \\ computing"],"programNumber":"11","session":["39"],"title":"PINOKY: A Ring-like Device that Gives Movement to Any Plush Toy","type":"vi"},"vi140":{"abstract":"Finger-worn devices are a greatly underutilized form of interaction with the surrounding world.

To facilitate large network analysis, GraphTrail integrates aggregation with familiar charts, drag-and-drop interaction on a canvas, and a novel pivoting mechanism for transitioning between aggregates.

It has been hypothesized to support collaborative sensemaking. In this paper, we examine some of the cognitive mechanisms assumed to underlie sensemaking, namely social imitation processes. We present a multinomial model that is applied to the generation of tags. In line with the semantic imitation model of Fu and colleagues, we assume that implicit processing can be understood as a semantic reconstruction of gist. Our model contrasts this process with a recall of tags from an explicit verbatim memory trace. We tested this model in an experimental study in which after the search task students had to generate tags themselves. We exposed their answers to a multinomial model derived from Fuzzy Trace Theory to obtain independent parameter estimates for the processes of explicit recall, semantic gist reconstruction and familiarity-based recall. As it turns out, a model that assumes all processes are at play explains the data well. Similar to results of our previous study, we find an influence of search intentions on the two processes. Our results have implications for interface and interaction design of social tagging systems, as well as for tag recommendation in these environments.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"paul seitlinger":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Austria","name":"Graz University of Technology"}],"email":"paul.seitlinger@tugraz.at","firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Seitlinger","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1288"]},"tobias ley":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Estonia","name":"Tallinn University"}],"email":"tobias_ley@yahoo.com","firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Ley","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1288"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Presents a multinomial model and experiment formalizing cognitive processes in social imitation in tagging.

Thus in safety-critical environments, it is often considered safer to perform tasks sequentially. Here we explore how the cost of accessing information affects the way people choose to interleave. An empirical study based on a medical scenario was conducted. Participants had to program infusion pump devices using information from a prescription form. The physical and mental effort involved in accessing information was manipulated. This was achieved by varying the physical distance between the prescription form and the devices. We demonstrate that by increasing information access cost, individuals are less likely to omit a required task step. This is because they adopt a more memory-intensive strategy, which encourages interleaving at natural boundaries, i.e., after completing the programming of one of the pumps. Interleaving during programming can result in task steps being forgotten.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"anna cox":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University College London"}],"email":"anna.cox@ucl.ac.uk","firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Cox","middleName":"L","submissions":["paper1330","paper1391","wp482","si112"]},"duncan brumby":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University College London"}],"email":"brumby@cs.ucl.ac.uk","firstName":"Duncan","lastName":"Brumby","middleName":"P","submissions":["paper1391","wp482","wp593","si112"]},"jonathan back":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University College London"}],"email":"j.back@ucl.ac.uk","firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Back","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1391"]}},"bestPaperAward":true,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Empirical study demonstrating that the cost of accessing information can impact on multitasking performance.

In particular, systems used in several recent experiments provided information about others' current activities so that their availability for conversation could be assessed, and interruptions could be timed strategically. One issue with these experimental systems, though, is that many do not notify the observed party that these observations are taking place. There is reason to believe that such notification could be valuable to users, and that it could alter observers' behavior. Moreover, factors such as the perceived urgency of the interruption could affect willingness to violate social norms in gathering information. We report on an experiment assessing the impact of perceived visibility and task urgency on awareness checking behavior. Results suggest that people check more often when they believe their partners do not know they are checking, and more often when the task is time-constrained than when it is not.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"jeremy birnholtz":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Cornell University"}],"email":"jbirnhol@gmail.com","firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Birnholtz","middleName":"","submissions":["paper750"]},"nanyi bi":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Cornell University"}],"email":"nb333@cornell.edu","firstName":"Nanyi","lastName":"Bi","middleName":"","submissions":["paper750"]},"susan fussell":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Cornell University, Ithaca"}],"email":"sfussell@cornell.edu","firstName":"Susan","lastName":"Fussell","middleName":"","submissions":["paper750"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Experimental study exploring effects of available time and notifying observed parties on gathering awareness information.

We evaluated the system by gathering screenshots for 3 applications, using the algorithm to match messages to screenshots, and comparing results to manual matches. We found that hard-to-reproduce error messages make it difficult to gather all the screenshots. The algorithm correctly matched messages to screenshots 80% of the time when a corresponding screenshot had been gathered.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"geza kovacs":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"email":"gkovacs@mit.edu","firstName":"Geza","lastName":"Kovacs","middleName":"","submissions":["sr116"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"ScreenMatch provides software translators with visual context for each translatable message, by matching each message with a corresponding screenshot of the application.","contactEmail":"gkovacs@mit.edu","contactFirstName":"Geza","contactLastName":"Kovacs","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"sr116","keywords":["internationalization","translation","ocr","text matching"],"programNumber":"SRC03","session":["36"],"title":"ScreenMatch: Providing Context to Software Translators by Displaying Screenshots","type":"sr"},"sr117":{"abstract":"Paper, as a tradition medium for art and communication, shows great potential as a good candidate for organic user interface (OUI), with its intrinsic deformability and flexibility.

By relaxing the optical projection metaphor, we can deviate from modeling perspective projection, for example, to con-strain scale or orientation, create multiple copies, or offset the image. VP also supports dynamic filtering based on the projection frustum, creating overview and detail applications, and selecting portions of a larger display for zooming and panning.

These data sets directly impact the accuracy and performance of the gesture recognition system and should ideally contain all natural variations of the movements associated with a gesture. This paper addresses the problem of collecting such gesture datasets. In particular, we investigate the question of what is the  most appropriate semiotic modality of instructions for conveying to human subjects the movements the system developer needs them to perform. The results of our qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate that the choice of modality has a significant impact on the performance of the learnt gesture recognition system; particularly in terms of correctness and coverage.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"helena mentis":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Microsoft Research"}],"email":"hementis@microsoft.com","firstName":"Helena","lastName":"Mentis","middleName":"M.","submissions":["paper817","wp286"]},"pushmeet kohli":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Microsoft Research"}],"email":"pkohli@microsoft.com","firstName":"Pushmeet","lastName":"Kohli","middleName":"","submissions":["paper817"]},"sebastian nowozin":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Microsoft Research"}],"email":"senowozi@microsoft.com","firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Nowozin","middleName":"","submissions":["paper817"]},"simon fothergill":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Cambridge"}],"email":"jsf29@cam.ac.uk","firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Fothergill","middleName":"","submissions":["paper817"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Findings regarding the affect of kinematic instruction modality on training gestural interactive systems.

While players participate in an ARG using everyday communications tools, such as phones and web sites, the interaction design challenges are not an \"everyday\" process. Designers must create and connect story bits across multiple media (video, audio, text) and multiple platforms (phones, computers, physical spaces).

In the 2005 Hurricane Katrina event, over 200,000 pets were displaced, and 95% of them were never reunited with their families. The US Department of Agriculture confirms that the problem of reuniting displaced pets and their guardians at this scale is unfortunately common in disaster events.

SocialProof begins with the output produced by ASR engines and enhances this output using the power of crowd intelligence via MTurk service. Our system splits one ASR dictation scenario into several smaller tasks, allowing multiple people to work on different pieces of the task at the same time. Data merging strategies are used to combine multiple responses from MTurk workers to provide improved results.

To seed discussion and action, participants will engage reflectively with the liveness of an authentic performance, experienced firsthand and at one-remove through a mediating technology, using an innovative video-based methodology.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"guy schofield":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Newcastle University"}],"email":"g.p.schofield@ncl.ac.uk","firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Schofield","middleName":"","submissions":["wo116","paper1448","paper611"]},"john mccarthy":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Ireland","name":"University College Cork, Ireland"}],"email":"john.mccarthy@ucc.ie","firstName":"John","lastName":"McCarthy","middleName":"","submissions":["wp454","wo116","si121"]},"jonathan hook":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Newcastle University"}],"email":"jonathan.hook@ncl.ac.uk","firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Hook","middleName":"","submissions":["wo116"]},"peter wright":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Newcastle University"}],"email":"p.c.wright@newcastle.ac.uk","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Wright","middleName":"","submissions":["paper730","paper498","wo116","si121"]},"robyn taylor":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Alberta"}],"email":"rltaylor@ualberta.ca","firstName":"Robyn","lastName":"Taylor","middleName":"","submissions":["wo116"]},"tom bartindale":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Newcastle University"}],"email":"tom@bartindale.com","firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Bartindale","middleName":"","submissions":["paper730","wo116"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"This workshop aims to explore how HCI might contribute to the understanding of, and design response to, shifting values of liveness brought about by advances in digitally mediated performance.","contactEmail":"j.d.hook@ncl.ac.uk","contactFirstName":"Jonathan","contactLastName":"Hook","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":["arts"],"id":"wo116","keywords":["design","digital arts","experience-centered design","expressive interfaces","liveness","performance",""],"programNumber":"25","session":["233"],"title":"Exploring HCI's Relationship with Liveness","type":"wo"},"wo117":{"abstract":"Game User Research is an emerging field that ties together Human Computer Interaction, Game Development, and Experimental Psychology, specifically investigating the interaction between players and games.

[Margolin 2005] \\  \\ In interface design, defamiliarization can be used to bring users&#8217; attention to the interface itself because of a temporary lack of fulfilment of expectations [Peterson, M.G., Iversen, O.S., Krogh, G.P 2004; Sengers, Gaver 2006]. This concept is particularly promising for the user interface in the context of &#8216;radical&#8217; innovation: it can be used as a tool to facilitate the uptake of such innovation, by serving as a source of delight for the user in the user experience. \\ Radical innovation presents substantial obstacles both to usability and to usability testing [Rogers, Y. Rutherford, A. Bibby, P. 1992]: such innovation stops users in their tracks by intentionally frustrating expectations. Defamiliarization, as some recent research has argued, can respond to this problem by causing users to step back from the process they are engaged in (i.e., trying to engage with an interface) to experience features of the interface itself, and to gain pleasure and fun from that interaction [Bell, Blythe, Sengers, 2005]. In the course of that step back, the innovative feature is discovered, and the user re-enters the primary process of &#8216;working with&#8217; the interface. \\  \\ A handful of designers are incorporating defamiliarization into their design strategies [Bell, Blythe, Sengers, 2005; Sengers, Gaver, 2006]. For instance, at Canonical, a major part of our design work on the Ubuntu operating system is concerned with &#8216;radical&#8217; innovation. We have substantial experience with such innovation threatening usability as it challenges conventions and habits. We have begun to employ defamiliarized user journeys as a facilitator of usability. There are two major aspects of this work: \\  \\ 1.Creating defamiliarized experiences that bring attention to the technology itself without introducing usability challenges, thereby supporting discovery; \\ 2.Evaluating defamiliarization. A central question for us is: how can we assess this technique as part of usability testing and qualitative feedback? \\  \\ As the literature evidences, there are many ways to use defamiliarization in design: \\ &#8226;\tjuxtaposing incongruities \\ &#8226;\tcreating unexpected contexts \\ &#8226;\texaggerating information \\ &#8226;\tproviding minimal representations \\ &#8226;\tcreating ambiguity \\ &#8226;\tusing extreme characters \\  \\ There are other methods that practitioners have not recognised but that they may use implicitly. \\  \\ Workshop Goals  \\  \\ Clarify ways defamiliarization can be successfully applied to interface design to create compelling experiences;  \\ Determine the reach and usefulness of defamiliarization for innovation; \\ Explore techniques that enhance the role defamiliarization can play in ease of use -- bridging, cues, etc; \\ Define user testing approaches to assess the success of defamiliarization efforts. \\","acmLink":null,"authors":{"calum pringle":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Canonical"}],"email":"Calum.pringle@canonical.com","firstName":"Calum","lastName":"Pringle","middleName":"","submissions":["wo123"]},"charline poirier":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Canonical"}],"email":"Charline.poirier@canonical.com","firstName":"Charline","lastName":"Poirier","middleName":"","submissions":["wo123"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"With innovation, designers need to ask how they can offer a non-disruptive and enjoyable user experience whilst at the same time not meeting users' expectations.

However, when looking at the literature, no real, concrete, hands-on answers are popping up yet. On the other hand, in industry and academia much tacit knowledge and experience must exist, about what worked before and what not. Analyzing systematically successful product introductions, tapping into that tacit knowledge, may help to derive heuristics that can support new product and service development, and aid in a better understanding of this elusive concept.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"bernt meerbeek":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Netherlands","name":"Philips Research"}],"email":"bernt.meerbeek@philips.com","firstName":"Bernt","lastName":"Meerbeek","middleName":"","submissions":["wo147"]},"elizabeth buie":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Luminanze Consulting, LLC"}],"email":"ebuie@luminanze.com","firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Buie","middleName":"","submissions":["wo147","wo103"]},"jettie hoonhout":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Netherlands","name":"Philips Research Europe"}],"email":"jettie.hoonhout@philips.com","firstName":"Jettie","lastName":"Hoonhout","middleName":"","submissions":["wo112","wo147"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"We all recognize cool products on the shelf; making these from scratch is quite another thing.

The analysis results are presented across four dimensions: queries, users, clicks, and actions, and lay the foundation for further advancement and research on the topic.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"ido guy":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Israel","name":"IBM Research"}],"email":"ido@il.ibm.com","firstName":"Ido","lastName":"Guy","middleName":"","submissions":["paper804","paper1523","paper1357"]},"inbal ronen":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Israel","name":"IBM Research"}],"email":"inbal@il.ibm.com","firstName":"Inbal","lastName":"Ronen","middleName":"","submissions":["paper804","paper1523","paper1357"]},"sara weber":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"IBM CIO's Office"}],"email":"sara_weber@us.ibm.com","firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Weber","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1357"]},"sigalit ur":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Israel","name":"IBM Research"}],"email":"sigalit@il.ibm.com","firstName":"Sigalit","lastName":"Ur","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1357"]},"tolga oral":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"IBM CIO's Office"}],"email":"tolga_oral@us.ibm.com","firstName":"Tolga","lastName":"Oral","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1357"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"We present Faces, an application built to allow effective large-scale people search in the enterprise, and its usage analysis within IBM along a time period of over 140 days.","contactEmail":"ido@il.ibm.com","contactFirstName":"Ido","contactLastName":"Guy","coreCommunities":["user experience"],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"paper1357","keywords":["people search","enterprise search","large scale"],"programNumber":"","session":["143"],"title":"Best Faces Forward: A Large-scale Study of People Search in the Enterprise","type":"paper"},"paper175":{"abstract":"Web users can help guide others through complex tasks in unfamiliar domains by creating ordered sequences of queries and Web pages, an activity we call trailblazing. The trails generated from this process can be surfaced by search engines to help users engaged in these tasks. However, if search engines are going to have people generate trails they need to understand whether there is value in using domain experts for trailblazing (or whether novices are sufficient). In this paper, we describe the findings of a user study of trailblazing in the medical domain, comparing domain novices and experts. We observed differences in how people in each of the groups blazed trails and the value of the trails they generated; experts were more efficient and generated better-quality trails. Although there has been significant research on contrasting novice and expert search behaviors, to our knowledge there is no work (at least in the search domain) on establishing whether artifacts created by domain experts (trails in our case) are more valuable than those created by novices. The answer to this question is important for system designers who want to learn whether investing in domain expertise is worthwhile.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"ryen white":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Microsoft Research"}],"email":"Ryen.White@microsoft.com","firstName":"Ryen","lastName":"White","middleName":"W","submissions":["paper889","paper265","paper236","paper175"]},"xiaojun yuan":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"State University of New York"}],"email":"xiaojunyuan@gmail.com","firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Yuan","middleName":"","submissions":["paper175"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"User study on the impact of domain knowledge on Web search trailblazing (creating URL sequences to help searchers).

This is due, in part, to search engines not providing feedback about how search behavior can be improved. Because feedback is an essential part of learning, we created the Search Dashboard, which provides an interface for reflection on personal search behavior. The Dashboard aggregates and presents an individual's search history and provides comparisons with that of archetypal expert profiles. Via a five-week study of 90 Search Dash-board users, we find that users are able to change aspects of their behavior to be more in line with that of the presented expert searchers. We also find that reflection can be beneficial, even without comparison, by changing participants' views about their own search skills, what is possible with search, and what aspects of their behavior may influence search success. Our findings demonstrate a new way for search engines to help users modify their search behavior for positive outcomes.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"jaime teevan":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Microsoft Research"}],"email":"teevan@microsoft.com","firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Teevan","middleName":"","submissions":["paper236","paper214","paper256"]},"ryen white":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Microsoft Research"}],"email":"Ryen.White@microsoft.com","firstName":"Ryen","lastName":"White","middleName":"W","submissions":["paper889","paper265","paper236","paper175"]},"scott bateman":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Saskatchewan"}],"email":"scott.bateman@usask.ca","firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Bateman","middleName":"","submissions":["paper236"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Describes the design of a reflective interface for search.

We raise implications for technologies to support DJs, while also shedding light on previous studies of music consumption and sharing in other settings.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"ahmed ahmed":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Nottingham"}],"email":"psxaaa@nottingham.ac.uk","firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Ahmed","middleName":"Yousif","submissions":["paper1672"]},"andy crabtree":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Nottingham"}],"email":"andy.crabtree@mac.com","firstName":"andy","lastName":"crabtree","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1672"]},"steve benford":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"University of Nottingham"}],"email":"sdb@cs.nott.ac.uk","firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Benford","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1672","al118","paper1548"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Presents an analysis of how DJs collect, prepare, perform and promote music.

Despite prior experience and training with individual personas, collaboration personas were preferred and better supported the task, since they focused on groups of people and their interactions.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"steve whittaker":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California at Santa Cruz"}],"email":"stevejohnwhittaker@googlemail.com","firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Whittaker","middleName":"","submissions":["paper572","paper1825","paper1688"]},"tara matthews":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"IBM Research - Almaden"}],"email":"tlmatthe@us.ibm.com","firstName":"Tara","lastName":"Matthews","middleName":"","submissions":["paper804","paper1825","paper1688"]},"tejinder judge":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Google Inc."}],"email":"tejinderjudge@google.com","firstName":"Tejinder","lastName":"Judge","middleName":"K.","submissions":["paper1825","paper1688"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Comparative study of individual vs. collaboration personas for a collaborative tool design and evaluation task.

We explore the service mediation activities of outreach, technological assistance, providing knowledge, and ongoing engagement. These activities bring to light how successful service relationships involve fostering a process, bridging relationships, and providing broader scaffolding. The results of our research highlight the role service mediation plays in the use of services and service technologies in information-rich organizations. This research extends previous conceptualizations of mediation by documenting how mediators support broader service processes for their clients, transform potential beneficiaries into clients, and engage in long term assistance. Therefore, this work moves beyond prior conceptualizations of mediation that concentrate solely on enabling access and use of specific technologies.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"amy voida":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Irvine"}],"email":"amyvoida@gmail.com","firstName":"Amy","lastName":"Voida","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1063","paper485","paper875"]},"gillian r. hayes":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Irvine"}],"email":"gillianrh@ics.uci.edu","firstName":"Gillian R.","lastName":"Hayes","middleName":"","submissions":["paper875"]},"lynn dombrowski":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Irvine"}],"email":"ldombrow@uci.edu","firstName":"Lynn","lastName":"Dombrowski","middleName":"","submissions":["paper875"]},"melissa mazmanian":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of California, Irvine"}],"email":"mmazmani@uci.edu","firstName":"Melissa","lastName":"Mazmanian","middleName":"","submissions":["paper875"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Extends the construct of mediation to service systems through a study of e-government outreach work.

Moreover, our tools, interactions, and infrastructures are tied intimately to human flourishing. In this SIGCHI Social Impact Award talk, I seek to inspire the CHI community to engage with socially significant issues. This talk will be a combination of personal reflections on building theory and method over a 20-year period, and a synthesis of core framings in value sensitive design. Along the way, I will dwell on method, examining roughly a dozen value sensitive design methods that taken as a whole can help researchers and designers account for human values in their technical endeavors. In so doing, I will expand the HCI design space beyond technical devices to infrastructure, policy, and social norms. Key to my discussion will be attention to the challenges of scale &#8211; across time, geography, cultures, and stakeholders. From method, I will make the turn to multi-lifespan information system design and concentrate my talk on the first project under that program &#8211; the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal which supports peace-building and reconciliation in the aftermath of widespread violence. I will close this talk with openings: open questions in value sensitive and multi-lifespan information system design; and, more broadly, open challenges for the HCI community as we imagine the tools, interactions, and infrastructures that will underlie the futures of societies. We set our sights on progress, not perfection. \\  \\ Biography Batya Friedman is a Professor in the Information School, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington where she directs the Value Sensitive Design Research Lab. Batya pioneered value sensitive design (VSD), an approach to account for human values in the design of information systems. First developed in human-computer interaction, VSD has since been used in information management, human-robotic interaction, computer security, civil engineering, applied philosophy, and land use and transportation. Her work has focused on a wide range of values, some include privacy in public, trust, freedom from bias, moral agency, sustainability, safety, calmness, freedom of expression, and human dignity; along with a range of technologies such as web browsers, urban simulation, robotics, open source tools, mobile computing, implantable medical devices, computer security, ubiquitous computing and computing infrastructure. She is currently working on multi-lifespan information system design and on methods for envisioning &#8211; new ideas for leveraging information systems to shape our futures. Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal is an early project in this multi-lifespan information system design program. Batya received both her B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"batya friedman":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"University of Washington"}],"email":"batya@uw.edu","firstName":"Batya","lastName":"Friedman","middleName":"","submissions":["in245","paper1610","sp110"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"","contactEmail":"batya@uw.edu","contactFirstName":"Batya","contactLastName":"Friedman","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"sp110","keywords":[""],"programNumber":"","session":["8"],"title":"Award Talk: Batya Friedman, Something of Value","type":"sp"}},"time":"11:30","title":"Social Impact Award: Batya Friedman","type":"Special Events"}},"Ballroom E":{"172":{"chairAffiliations":"Google, USA","chairs":["Daniel M.

We also discuss the impact of a task-oriented approach to window management on other aspects of user behavior, and the implications of this for future system design.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"craig tashman":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Georgia Tech"}],"email":"craig@cc.gatech.edu","firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Tashman","middleName":"","submissions":["to118"]},"keith edwards":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Georgia Tech"}],"email":"keith@cc.gatech.edu","firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Edwards","middleName":"","submissions":["to118"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Deployment study of a scaling window manager that supports organization and grouping.

With BinCam, we explore informational and normative social influences as a source of change, which has to date been underexplored in persuasive HCI.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"anja thieme":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"}],"email":"anja.thieme@newcastle.ac.uk","firstName":"Anja","lastName":"Thieme","middleName":"","submissions":["in142"]},"ashur rafiev":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom"}],"email":"ashur.rafiev@newcastle.ac.uk","firstName":"Ashur","lastName":"Rafiev","middleName":"","submissions":["in142"]},"nick taylor":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Newcastle University"}],"email":"nick.taylor@newcastle.ac.uk","firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Taylor","middleName":"","submissions":["in142","paper730","paper498","wp204"]},"patrick olivier":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Newcastle University"}],"email":"p.l.olivier@ncl.ac.uk","firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Olivier","middleName":"","submissions":["in142","paper633","paper730","paper498","paper1510","wp323","paper1448","paper388","wp258","paper611","wp204","si121","paper1541","paper1429"]},"rob comber":{"affiliations":[{"country":"UK","name":"Newcastle University"}],"email":"robert.comber@newcastle.ac.uk","firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Comber","middleName":"","submissions":["in142","paper633","wo112","paper388"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"","contactEmail":"anja-thieme@gmx.de","contactFirstName":"Anja","contactLastName":"Thieme","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"in142","keywords":["home \\ user studies \\ user interface design \\ sustainability"],"programNumber":"2","session":["221"],"title":"BinCam &#8211; A Social Persuasive System to Improve Waste Behaviors","type":"in"},"in144":{"abstract":"Using a dedicated twitter account, participants are encouraged to send their prayers, blessings and wishes to the RobotBuddha shrine.

The haptic architecture consists of three main elements, namely, haptic engine, haptic API/codec, and haptic display. The haptic engine extracts events from the game, assigns haptic feedback to these events, and sends coded packets to haptic API/codec. The haptic API/codec translates the coded packets and computes driving signals based on carefully evaluated algorithms derived from psychophysical modeling of tactile perception. The driving signals are then routed to the haptic display embedded with an array of vibratory transducers. A user feels high resolution and refined tactile sensations on the body through the display.

Moreover, the avatar has an anthropomorphic face that enables the user who controls it to communicate with people co-located with the user who wears it. We have a field test by using TEROOS and observed that the wearable avatar innovatively assisted the users to communicate during their joint activities such as route navigating and buying goods at a shop. The user controlling TEROOS could give the user wearing it appropriate route instructions on the basis of the situation around TEROOS. In addition, both users could easily identify objects that they discussed. Moreover, shop staff members communicated with the user controlling TEROOS and behaved as they normally would when the user asked questions about the goods.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"hirotaka osawa":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"osawa@ayu.ics.keio.ac.jp","firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Osawa","middleName":"","submissions":["paper120","in114","vi135","in190"]},"kazuhiko shinozawa":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"ATR Intelligent Robotics and Communication Laboratories"}],"email":"shino@atr.co.jp","firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Shinozawa","middleName":"","submissions":["paper120","vi135","in190"]},"michita imai":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"michita@ayu.ics.keio.ac.jp","firstName":"Michita","lastName":"Imai","middleName":"","submissions":["paper120","in114","vi135","in190"]},"tadakazu kashiwabara":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Japan","name":"Keio University"}],"email":"kashi@ayu.ics.keio.ac.jp","firstName":"Tadakazu","lastName":"Kashiwabara","middleName":"","submissions":["paper120","vi135","in190"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"The note describes what communication style a wearable robot avatar offers to daily life situations.

It introduces a timely and long-term endeavor, the development of a visual language and interface connecting researchers, designers, and operators in the study of human-machine teams.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"david mindell":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"email":"mindell@mit.edu","firstName":"David","lastName":"Mindell","middleName":"","submissions":["in231"]},"yanni loukissas":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"email":"yanni@mit.edu","firstName":"Yanni","lastName":"Loukissas","middleName":"","submissions":["in231"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Using historical data sets from the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing, the project presents opportunities and challenges in the visual display of sociotechnical data.","contactEmail":"yanni@mit.edu","contactFirstName":"Yanni","contactLastName":"Loukissas","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"in231","keywords":["human-machine relationships","social studies of technology","data visualization"],"programNumber":"2","session":["221"],"title":"A Visual Display of Sociotechnical Data","type":"in"},"in236":{"abstract":"Sketch It, Make It (SIMI) is a modeling tool that enables non-experts \\ to design items for fabrication with laser cutters.

In an evaluation of one such system, we demonstrate that a majority of international participants preferred their personalized versions over a non-adapted interface of the same web site.

Unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. While the accuracies of understanding speech input are still discouraging for many applications under less-than-ideal conditions, several interesting areas are yet to be explored that could make speech-based interaction truly hands-free. The goal of this course is to inform the HCI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition works, what are its limitations, and how it could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"cosmin munteanu":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"National Research Council Canada"}],"email":"cosmin.munteanu@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca","firstName":"Cosmin","lastName":"Munteanu","middleName":"","submissions":["cs188","wp519","cr136"]},"gerald penn":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Toronto"}],"email":"gpenn@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Penn","middleName":"","submissions":["wp519","cr136"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Learn how speech recognition works, what are its limitations and usability challenges, how it could be used to enhance interaction paradigms, and what is the current research and commercial state-of-the-art.","contactEmail":"cosmin.munteanu@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca","contactFirstName":"Cosmin","contactLastName":"Munteanu","coreCommunities":["user experience"],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"cr136","keywords":[],"programNumber":"29","session":["101"],"title":"Course 29: Hands-Free Interfaces: The Myths, Challenges, and Opportunities of Speech-Based Interaction","type":"cr"}},"time":"14:30","title":"Course 29: Hands-Free Interfaces: The Myths, Challenges, and Opportunities of Speech-Based Interaction","type":"Course"}},"16AB":{"161":{"chairAffiliations":"University of Leicester, UK","chairs":["Effie Law"],"coreCommunities":["engineering"],"date":"May 9, 2012","endTime":"15:50","featuredCommunities":[],"hasAward":false,"hasHonorableMention":true,"id":"161","notes":"","room":"16AB","submissions":{"paper134":{"abstract":"Remote asynchronous usability testing involves users directly in reporting usability problems.

Among many findings, the study showed that users do take advantage of recall support in interfaces, preferring those that provide it.

Common approaches to authenticate a user on a mobile phone are based either on entering a PIN, a password, or drawing a pattern. However, these authentication methods are vulnerable to the shoulder surfing attack. The risk of this attack has increased since means for recording high-resolution videos are cheaply and widely accessible. If the attacker can videotape the authentication process, PINs, passwords, and patterns do not even provide the most basic level of security. In this project, we assessed the vulnerability of a magnetic gestural authentication method to the video-based shoulder surfing attack. We chose a scenario that is favourable to the attack-er. In a real world environment, we videotaped the interactions of four users performing magnetic signatures on a phone, in the presence of HD cameras from four different angles. We then recruited 22 participants and asked them to watch the videos and try to forge the signatures. The results revealed that with a certain threshold, i.e, th=1.67, none of the forging attacks was successful, whereas at this level all eligible login attempts were successfully recognized. The qualitative feedback also indicated that users found the magnetic gestural signature authentication method to be more secure than PIN-based and 2D signature methods.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"albrecht schmidt":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"University of Stuttgart"}],"email":"albrecht.schmidt@acm.org","firstName":"Albrecht","lastName":"Schmidt","middleName":"","submissions":["paper103","paper521","wp411"]},"alireza sahami shirazi":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"University of Stuttgart"}],"email":"alireza.sahami@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Sahami Shirazi","middleName":"","submissions":["paper521"]},"hamed ketabdar":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Germany","name":"Quality and Usability Lab, Deutsche Telekom Laboratories"}],"email":"hamed.ketabdar@telekom.de","firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Ketabdar","middleName":"","submissions":["paper521"]},"peyman moghadam":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Australia","name":"Autonomous Systems Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre"}],"email":"peym.mo@gmail.com","firstName":"Peyman","lastName":"Moghadam","middleName":"","submissions":["paper521"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"The vulnerability of magnetic gestural authentication to video-based shoulder surfing attacks is assessed through a realistic scenario by videotaping the authentication interaction from four different angles and providing them to adversaries","contactEmail":"alireza.sahami@vis.uni-stuttgart.de","contactFirstName":"Alireza","contactLastName":"Sahami","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"paper521","keywords":["magnet","signature","mobile phone","authentication"],"programNumber":"","session":["192"],"title":"Assessing the Vulnerability of Magnetic Gestural  Authentication to Video-Based Shoulder Surfing Attacks","type":"paper"},"paper605":{"abstract":"Cognitive neuroscience defines the sense of agency as the experience of controlling one's own actions and, through this control, affecting the external world.

As a result, collaboration with the right individuals, teams and institutions is increasingly crucial for scientific progress. We propose &#8220;research networking systems&#8221; (RNS) as a new type  of system designed to help scientists identify and choose collaborators, and suggest a corresponding research agenda. The research agenda covers four areas: Foundations, Presentation, Architecture and Evaluation. Foundations includes project-, institution- and discipline-specific motivational factors; the role of social networks; and impression formation based on information beyond expertise and interests. Presentation addresses representing expertise in a comprehensive and up-to-date manner; the role of controlled vocabularies and folksonomies; the tension between seekers&#8217; need for comprehensive information and potential collaborators&#8217; desire to control how they are seen by others; and the need to support serendipitous discovery of collaborative opportunities. Architecture considers aggregation and synthesis of information from multiple  sources, social system interoperability,  and integration with the user&#8217;s primary work context. Lastly,  Evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions, measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic methods. We hope that this paper stimulates the human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work and related communities to pursue a broad and comprehensive agenda for developing research networking systems","acmLink":null,"authors":{"brian butler":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Pittsburgh"}],"email":"bbutler@pitt.edu","firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Butler","middleName":"","submissions":["to121"]},"heiko spallek":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Pittsburgh"}],"email":"hspallek@pitt.edu","firstName":"Heiko","lastName":"Spallek","middleName":"","submissions":["to121"]},"mei song":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Pittsburgh"}],"email":"mes170@pitt.edu","firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Song","middleName":"","submissions":["to121"]},"titus schleyer":{"affiliations":[{"country":"","name":"University of Pittsburgh"}],"email":"titus@pitt.edu","firstName":"Titus","lastName":"Schleyer","middleName":"","submissions":["to121"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Comprehensive research agenda for Research Networking Systems, a new type of application designed to help scientists find collaborators.

To determine criteria for success in this context, we borrow the concept of Active Prolonged Engagement (APE) from the science museum literature. Research on APE sets a high standard for visitor engagement and learning, and it offers a number of useful concepts and measures for research on interactive surfaces in the wild. In this paper we adapt and expand on these measures and apply them to our tabletop exhibit.

To understand these results, we analyze visitor conversation at the exhibit.

These systems show physical activity information (e.g., step counts, energy expenditure, heart rate) which is sufficient for many self-knowledge needs, but information about the factors that affect physical activity may be needed for deeper self-reflection and increased self-knowledge. We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies.

Although our interviews showed that the participants are generally happy with their neighborhoods, there are still some barriers to overcome in personal communication between neighbors. These are mostly time related or because of overacted cautiousness. The interviews further showed that gift-giving often improves relationships and enables communication. These findings led to a couple of design ideas of which we chose the most promising to investigate further. Our final solution was a concept of a mobile agent ``SharryBot'' which can distribute gifts among the neighborhood and thereby connecting people in an effective way.

Much research has been conducted into helping couples overcome the problems associated with long distance relationships (LDRs) and many steps have been made towards solving it through enabling them to keep in contact via video, audio, or visual artifacts. Our approach supplements these traditional communication mediums by exploiting &#8220;touch&#8221; &#8211; a sensation that is dominant in almost every relationship. We designed, built and tested a prototype touch device, with the intention of bringing couples closer together during a regular Skype conversation, by allowing each to feel the other&#8217;s touch.

We have implemented a iRotate that works in real-time on iPhone and iPad, and we assess the accuracy and limitations of iRotate through a 20- participant feasibility study.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"fang-i hsiao":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Taiwan","name":"National Taiwan University"}],"email":"kamebkj@gmail.com","firstName":"Fang-I","lastName":"Hsiao","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1158","in171"]},"lung-pan cheng":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Taiwan","name":"National Taiwan University"}],"email":"xman.l.cheng@gmail.com","firstName":"Lung-Pan","lastName":"Cheng","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1158","in171"]},"mike y. chen":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Taiwan","name":"National Taiwan University"}],"email":"mikechen@csie.ntu.edu.tw","firstName":"Mike Y.","lastName":"Chen","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1158","in171"]},"yen-ting liu":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Taiwan","name":"National Taiwan University"}],"email":"b97901121@ntu.edu.tw","firstName":"Yen-Ting","lastName":"Liu","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1158","in171"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Our paper makes two contributions: 1) a new approach to automatic screen rotation based on users' face orientation instead of device orientation, 2) quantified the feasibility of using front-camera based approach.","contactEmail":"xmanlch@gmail.com","contactFirstName":"Lung-Pan","contactLastName":"Cheng","coreCommunities":["design","user experience"],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"paper1158","keywords":["device orientation","face detection","auto rotation",""],"programNumber":"","session":["181"],"title":"iRotate: Automatic Screen Rotation based on Face Orientation","type":"paper"},"paper1607":{"abstract":"Proximate mobile devices that are aware of their orientation relative to one another can support novel and natural forms of interaction.

We implemented this method as a service called Orienteer, which provides mobile device with the orientation of other proximate mobile devices. We demonstrate that orientation information can be used to enable novel and natural interactions by developing two applications that allow the user to push content in the direction of another device to share it and point the device toward another to filter content based on the device&#8217;s owner. An informal evaluation revealed that interactions built upon orientation information can be natural and compelling to users, but developers and designers need to carefully consider how orientation should be applied effectively.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"david dearman":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Nokia Research Center"}],"email":"dearman@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"David","lastName":"Dearman","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1608","paper1607"]},"khai truong":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Toronto"}],"email":"khai@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"Khai","lastName":"Truong","middleName":"N","submissions":["paper845","paper1716","paper1608","paper1607"]},"richard guy":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Canada","name":"University of Toronto"}],"email":"guy@cs.toronto.edu","firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Guy","middleName":"T","submissions":["paper1716","paper1607"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"Novel method to determine the relative orientation or proximate mobile device using only their backside camera.

Thus, most smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar devices can be used. Phone as a Pixel uses a color-transition encoding scheme to identify and locate displays. This approach has several advantages: devices can be arbitrarily arranged (i.e., not in a grid) and infrastructure consists of a single conventional camera. Further, additional devices can join at any time without re-calibration. These are desirable properties to enable collective displays in contexts like sporting events, concerts and political rallies.

In this paper, we introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where users&#8217; utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification. For fast correction, users leverage a marking menu using touch gestures. Voice Typing aspires to create an experience akin to having a secretary type for you, while you monitor and correct the text. In a user study where participants composed emails using both Voice Typing and traditional dictation, they not only reported lower cognitive demand for Voice Typing but also exhibited 29% relative reduction of user corrections.

But Cool is hard to pin down&#65533;there&#65533;s no accepted way to define it, measure it, or design for it.

Alternating strokes between hands doubles the number of accessible menu items for the same number of strokes, and is similar in performance to using a one-handed marking menu. We also examine how stroke direction affects performance. When using thumbs on an iPod Touch, drawing strokes upwards and inwards is faster than other directions.

However, reducing electricity use can be difficult with only a meter and a monthly or annual electricity bill. With the emergence of new power meters units, information on electricity consumption is now available digitally and wirelessly. This enables the design and deployment of a new class of persuasive systems giving consumers insight into their use of energy resources and means for reducing it.

However, children's input and ideas require careful interpretation to reach viable designs and technical specifications, which poses a significant challenge to an adult design research team. In this paper we discuss our approach to managing the complexity of combining concepts and ideas that were generated through participatory design work with the practical, technical, ethical and theoretical constraints of developing a technologically enhanced learning environment for children with and without Autism Spectrum Conditions. We found that the nature of this design problem did not lend itself to be rationally reduced to produce a single solution, but required an understanding of interpretive and speculative approaches for us to be able to cope with the complexity of requirements. We describe a workshop in which members of the design team used such approaches to develop a design brief that is faithful to the children's input.

In HCI, it is often assumed that the designer is the agent that acts intentionally in the design process. Contrary to this, recent notions of agency provide a way of analysing the performative role of design materials as intra-actions between components within a given phenomenon, rather than as meanings merely ascribed by actions of designers. The notion of agency puts focus on the emerging properties of materials and how they actively contribute to the way that design activity unfolds.  The analyses showed how interaction design is to a large extent driven by emergent characteristics of available materials. The results have implications for understanding material interactions and materiality in interaction design.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"chiara rossitto":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Sweden","name":"Stockholm University"}],"email":"chiara@dsv.su.se","firstName":"Chiara","lastName":"Rossitto","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1926"]},"jakob tholander":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Sweden","name":"Mobile Life, Stockholm University"}],"email":"jakobth@dsv.su.se","firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Tholander","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1415","paper1926"]},"maria normark":{"affiliations":[{"country":"Sweden","name":"Mobile Life Centre"}],"email":"maria.normark@sh.se","firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Normark","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1926"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":false,"cAndB":"The notion of agency is used to analyse materiality in interaction design.

In particular the algorithm models natural human grasping of virtual objects with more fidelity than previously demonstrated. A qualitative study highlights rich emergent 3D interactions, using hands and real-world objects. The implementation of HoloDesk is described in full, and example application scenarios explored.

In this paper we develop and investigate new methods for filtering and assessing the verity of sources found through social media by journalists. We take a human centered design approach to developing a system, SRSR (\"Seriously Rapid Source Review\"), informed by journalistic practices and knowledge of information production in events. We then used the system, together with a realistic reporting scenario, to evaluate the filtering and visual cue features that we developed. Our evaluation offers insights into social media information sourcing practices and challenges, and highlights the role technology can play in the solution.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"mor naaman":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Rutgers University"}],"email":"mor@rutgers.edu","firstName":"Mor","lastName":"Naaman","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1573"]},"munmun de choudhury":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Rutgers University"}],"email":"mdechoud@asu.edu","firstName":"Munmun","lastName":"De Choudhury","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1573"]},"nicholas diakopoulos":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Rutgers University"}],"email":"nicholas.diakopoulos@gmail.com","firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Diakopoulos","middleName":"","submissions":["paper1573"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"Design and evaluation of a system for journalists to filter and assess the verity of sources found through social media, including eyewitness, user-archetype classifiers, and network and location cues.","contactEmail":"nicholas.diakopoulos@gmail.com","contactFirstName":"Nicholas","contactLastName":"Diakopoulos","coreCommunities":[],"featuredCommunities":[],"id":"paper1573","keywords":["computational journalism","social media","news events"],"programNumber":"","session":["188"],"title":"Finding and Assessing Social Media Information Sources in the Context of Journalism","type":"paper"},"paper1750":{"abstract":"Judging topical expertise of micro-blogger is one of the key challenges for information seekers when deciding which information sources to follow.

This paper evaluates CTE1.2 predictions against observed human behavior on 108 tasks (36 tasks on 3 distinct website layouts).

Tome collects user-interaction histories via an interface instrumentation library as end users complete tasks; these histories are compiled using the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) into task completion-time predictions using CogTool.  With many histories, Tome can model prevailing strategies for tasks without needing an HCI specialist to describe users' interaction steps.  An unimplemented design change can be evaluated by perturbing a Tome task model in CogTool to reflect the change, giving a new performance prediction.  We found that predictions for quick (5-60s) query tasks in an instrumented brain-map interface averaged within 10% of measured expert times.  Finally, we modified a Tome model to predict closely the speed-up yielded by a proposed interaction before implementing it.","acmLink":null,"authors":{"david laidlaw":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Brown University"}],"email":"dhl@cs.brown.edu","firstName":"David","lastName":"Laidlaw","middleName":"H","submissions":["paper805","paper156","paper784"]},"steven gomez":{"affiliations":[{"country":"USA","name":"Brown University"}],"email":"steveg@cs.brown.edu","firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Gomez","middleName":"R","submissions":["paper805","paper156"]}},"bestPaperAward":false,"bestPaperNominee":true,"cAndB":"Describes a system for human performance modeling that utilizes interaction histories from a crowd of end users.
