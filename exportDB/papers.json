        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first formal study of how mothers of young children (aged three and under) use social networking sites, particularly Facebook and Twitter, including mothers' perceptions of which SNSes are appropriate for sharing information about their children, changes in post style and frequency after birth, and the volume and nature of child-related content shared in these venues. Our findings have implications for improving the utility and usability of SNS tools for mothers of young children, as well as for creating and improving sociotechnical systems related to maternal and child health.",

        "abstract": "Feedback on designs is critical for helping users iterate toward effective solutions. This paper presents Voyant, a novel system giving users access to a non-expert crowd to receive structured feedback on the perceptions of their designs from a target audience. Based on a formative study, the system generates the elements seen in a design, the order in which elements are noticed, impressions formed when the design is first viewed, and interpretation of the design relative to guidelines in the domain and the user's stated goals. An evaluation of the system was conducted with users and their designs. Users reported the feedback about impressions and interpretation of their goals was most helpful, though the other feedback types were also valued. Users found the coordinated views in Voyant useful for analyzing relations between the crowd's perception of a design and the visual elements within it. The monetary cost of generating the feedback was considered a fair tradeoff for not having to organize critiques or interrupt peers.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on a qualitative study of social media use for political deliberation by 21 U.S. citizens. In observing people's interactions in the \"sprawling public sphere\" across multiple social media tools (in both political and non-political spaces), we found that social media supported the interactional dimensions of deliberative democracy-- the interaction with media and the interaction between people. People used multiple tools through which they: were serendipitously exposed to diverse political information, constructed diverse information feeds, disseminated diverse information, and engaged in respectful and reasoned political discussions with diverse audiences. When people's civic agency was inhibited when using a tool, they often adopted or re-appropriated another tool. Contrary to the polarization perspective, we find that people were purposefully seeking diverse information and discussants. On a deeper level, some individuals altered their perspectives as a result of the interactions they were having in the online public sphere.",

        "abstract": "One growing use of computer-based communication media is the gathering of people in initiating or sustaining social events. Although the use of computer-mediated communication and social network sites such as Facebook for event promotion is becoming popular, online participation in an event does not always translate to offline attendance. In this paper, we report on an interview study that examines how people handle online event invitations and what influences their online and offline participation. The results show that people's event participation is shaped by their social perceptions of the event's nature (e.g., public or private), their relationships to others (e.g., the strength of their connections to other invitees), and the medium used to communicate event information (e.g., targeted invitation via email or spam communication via Facebook event page). By exploring how people decide whether to participate online or offline, the results illuminate the sophisticated nature of the mechanisms that affect participation and has design implications that can bridge virtual and real attendance.",

        "abstract": "Social Internet content plays an increasingly critical role in many domains, including public health, disaster management, and politics. However, its utility is limited by missing geographic information; for example, fewer than 1.6% of Twitter messages (tweets) contain a geotag. We propose a scalable, content-based approach to estimate the location of tweets using a novel yet simple variant of gaussian mixture models. Further, because real-world applications depend on quantified uncertainty of such estimates, we propose novel metrics of accuracy, precision, and calibration, and we evaluate our approach accordingly. Experiments on 13 million global, comprehensively multi-lingual tweets show that our approach yields reliable, well-calibrated results competitive with previous computationally intensive methods. We also show that a relatively small number of training data are required for good estimates (roughly 30,000 tweets), and models are quite time-invariant (effective on tweets many weeks newer than the training set). Finally, we show that toponyms and languages with small geographic footprint provide the most useful location signals.",

While research in CSCW has studied how specific social cues might facilitate collaboration in specific tasks, such as the role of gestures in video instruction, how a range of communicative cues might facilitate activities across many collaborative settings is unknown. In this paper, we model the predictive relationships between facial, gestural, and vocal cues and collaborative outcomes in three different tasks, drawing conclusions on how each cue might contribute to these outcomes in a given task and how such relationships generalize across tasks. The results highlight differences in how collaborators use gaze, the importance of shared context for some tasks, and how different gestures (particularly deictic gestures) facilitate collaborative outcomes. Our findings offer key theoretical and design insights.",

In this paper, we describe a comprehensive large-scale data-driven study of donation behavior. We analyze a two-month anonymized email log from several perspectives motivated by past studies on charitable giving: demographics, user interest, external time-related factors and social network influence. We show that email captures the demographic peculiarities of different interest groups, for instance, predicting demographic distributions found in US 2012 Presidential Election exit polls. Furthermore, we find that people respond to major national events, as well as to solicitations with special promotions, and that social connections are the most important factor in predicting donation behavior. Specifically, we identify trends not only for individual charities and campaigns, but also for high-level categories such as political campaigns, medical illnesses, and humanitarian relief. Thus, we show the extent to which large-scale email datasets reveal human donation behavior, and explore the limitations of such analysis.",

We investigate how the local IT development work is shaped by the global setup in GSD and argue that the bank had cultural blind spots toward the changes in Denmark. Three critical issues were neglected due to the cultural blind spots: 1) increased number of interruptions, 2) lack of translucence of remote colleagues' work, and 3) the re-definition of boundaries between work and articulation work. The implications of these findings include considerations for how to organize GSD practices and prepare the organizational changes that occur when moving from a co-located software development organization to an inter-organizational geographically distributed organization. Also our findings open up discussions about the professional identity of IT developers within GSD, which includes extending the qualifications for IT developers.",

Till now, however, the scale of urban perception studies has been considerably constrained by the quantity of experimental subjects used. That is why we have been working on a crowdsourcing project that can help us find out what it is about the look of a particular neighborhood that makes it appear to be beautiful, quiet, and happy. We collect votes from more than 3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of urban perception (i.e., of aesthetic capital). By then using state-of-the-art image processing techniques,  we determine the visual cues that make a place appear beautiful, quiet, and happy. The amount of greenery is the most positively associated visual cue with each of three qualities; by contrast, broad streets,  fortress-like buildings, and council houses tend to be negatively associated.

We analyze different conceptualizations of craft in accounts of software development, including craft as a process of building, craft as materiality, and craft as a community of practice. By working through the different facets of craft as elicited in the specific context of software development, we investigate tensions of perceiving coding work as, on the one hand, highly rational, and on the other, deeply personal and embodied. In working through these tensions of code as abstract and concrete, cerebral and intuitive, we note implications for craft, both as a theory relevant to computer human interaction, and for paradigms of education in computer science.",

Many systems use competitive elements, for example point scoring and leaderboards, to achieve these ends. However, while competition may motivate some people, it can have a neutral or demotivating effect on others. In this paper we explore theories of personal and social norms and investigate normification as an alternative approach to engagement, to be used alongside or instead of competitive strategies. We provide a systematic review of existing crowdsourcing and citizen science literature and categorise the ways that theories of norms have been incorporated to date. We then present qualitative interview data from a pro-environmental crowdsourcing study, Close the Door, which reveals normalising attitudes in certain participants. We assess how this links with competitive behaviour and participant performance. Based on our findings and analysis of norm theories, we consider the implications for designers wishing to use normification as an engagement strategy in crowdsourcing and citizen science systems.",

Lag compensation techniques have been proposed to try and maintain consistency. However, these techniques do not address all of the issues that arise due to diverging states. In particular, current understanding of consistency maintenance does not indicate how to make game-critical decisions when there are divergent views, nor does it indicate how to repair inconsistencies. These two issues - decision-making and error repair - can have substantial effects on how players view the game, but there is little information about these effects. To address this shortcoming, we carried out an experiment to test the effects of different choices. Our study confirms that decision-making and error repair can have significant effects on player experience and performance, and shows that that simple consistency is often not as important as these other factors.

The study suggests that many rural enterprises are micro in character, that they are not driven by the need to grow, and that value is and can be added in different ways that reflect the social values oriented to and employed by micro businesses and their consumers. The paper elaborates vernacular understandings of supply chains and their coordination, along with business and consumer motivations to consider alternative possibilities for design that place emphasis on making micro rural enterprise 'pay a bit better' rather than scaling it up.",

Therefore, how clinicians gather information, identify problems and make decisions concerning patients is a crucial concern, a process that can be labelled 'achieving overview'. In the process, clinicians use various artefacts amongst which medical records are central. Decades of experience is embedded in the structure and use of paper-based records. However, the development of electronic patient records (EPR) will change both structure and use of medical records, including 'achieving overview'. We conducted an ethnographic study in a hospital ward using paper-based medical records in order to understand how clinicians achieve overview'. Inspired by the approach of exnovation, we elicit the use of paper-based records in order to inform the design of EPRs. We propose five axes which span out the process of achieving overview and describe implications for design of EPRs.",

        "abstract": "The high complexity of knowledge-intensive work such as software development makes it beneficial to have spaces for formal and informal articulation work. Existing information systems (IS) tend to treat these different aspects of coordination separately, resulting in problems of awareness and coordination. In this paper, we present the concept of Articulation Spaces which combines aspects of Coordination Mechanisms and Common Information Spaces (CIS) in order to provide a room for mediating between the formal and informal aspects of coordination. Based on a design study in the form of a lightweight public display, we test the concept in a medium-sized German software company with regard to its implications for coordination support and show how Articulation Spaces provide information for meta-coordination, raise awareness and facilitate serendipitous knowledge exchange. Our findings provide insights into the design of CIS for flexible and coordination-intensive contexts such as software development work. ",

There are, however, relatively few accounts that look across multiple communities across the lifespan. In this paper, we reflect on four case studies of research on different online health communities in order to identify patterns in how individuals selectively adopt, use, and disengage from these communities throughout their lives. We argue that users leaving communities is not necessarily a failing of the site's design or purpose; rather, it is a logical reaction to changing life circumstances. In characterizing this pattern, we contribute a set of implications for design and management that bear consideration by online community designers, developers, moderators, and end users. Ultimately this may lead to a smoother transition from community to community and ensure that social support needs are being met more consistently in response to changing life circumstances.",

We validate our methods using qualitative analysis as well as quantitative analysis on data from a large international news network, for a set of articles generating more than 3,000,000 visits and 200,000 social media reactions. We show that it is possible to model accurately the overall traffic articles will ultimately receive by observing the first ten to twenty minutes of social media reactions. Achieving the same prediction accuracy with visits alone would require to wait for three hours of data.

By examining activities of scaling we can better understand diverse kinds of size and growth within sociotechnical systems. ",

This paper uses the framework to compare how diverse research methods employed in social computing surface values and make them visible to researchers. The framework provides a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method for observing values dimensions.

There are often complaints about the lack of replication studies in disciplines related to CSCW (particularly Software Engineering and HCI). However, these complaints are usually embedded in wider attempts to install a principled scientific method within these disciplines. Plans and Situated Actions was not a scientific text but drew upon naturalistic analysis. This paper argues there has been value in recreating Plans and Situated Actions (specifically in being able to explore laboratory issues unexplored in the original, and in understanding the book as being about more than instruction following). However the paper argues that recreating the study has not and cannot constitute a scientific replication. The paper concludes that recreating studies should not be conflated with replication.",

In this paper, we evaluate whether these measures also work as indicators for performance, shared understanding, and team trust in longer-duration project teams, using only limited, unobtrusively obtained communication traces. In our four-month evaluation using student project team emails, we found no support for LSM or most of the previously identified measures as practical indicators in our field setting.

To solve this issue, we set out to devise a system of verification frameworks and a software tool, that are independent of specific OT algorithms and able to exhaustively cover all possible transformation cases in which puzzles (if any) will manifest themselves. With the support of these tools, we verified OT correctness and concluded: all puzzles, under basic data and operation models and established transformation properties, have been discovered and resolved.

We provide opportunities and recommendations for technologies in hospice, including the need for varying degrees of richness and symmetry, and for support for life-affirming acts.

Crowdfunding lessens this risk by only calling in donations when an effort reaches a collective goal. However, it leaves unsolved the harder problem of mobilizing time and effort. We generalize the concept into activation thresholds, commitments that are conditioned on others' participation: supporters only need to show up if enough other people commit as well. We present Catalyst, which introduces activation thresholds for on-demand events. For complex coordination needs, Catalyst also includes thresholds for time and role. Catalyst users have organized events including volunteering, on-demand study groups, and mass participation events like a human chess game.

We show that this narration ignores a rich set of highly specialized topics, ranging from geology, neurology, to astrophysics and karate, being discussed by their own topical groups. We present a detailed characterization of these topical groups based on their network structures and tweeting behaviors. Analyzing these groups on the backdrop of the common identity and bond theory in social sciences, shows that these groups exhibit characteristics of topical identity based groups, rather than social bond based ones.",

        "abstract": "In story writing, the diverse perspectives of the crowd could support an author's search for the perfect character, setting, or plot. However, structuring crowd collaboration is challenging. Too little structure leads to unfocused, sprawling narratives, and too much structure stifles creativity. Motivated by the idea that individual creative leaders and the crowd have complementary creative strengths, we present an approach where a leader directs the high-level vision for a story and articulates creative constraints for the crowd. This approach is embodied in Ensemble, a novel collaborative story-writing platform. In a month-long short story competition, over one hundred volunteer users on the web started over fifty short stories using Ensemble. Leaders used the platform to direct collaborator work by establishing creative goals, and collaborators contributed meaningful, high-level ideas to stories through specific suggestions. This work suggests that asymmetric creative contributions may support a broad new class of creative collaborations.",

Technologies have enabled and facilitated the creation and consumption of digitized history content provided by official history institutions as well as individuals. Although much research has been conducted to understand technical and social aspects of digital cultural heritage, little empirical research has investigated how people perceive, experience, and interact with community content that is socially generated and tied to locations, particularly with respect to building community heritage. To address this, we developed a mobile application called LSC (anonymized) and conducted a user study with 34 participants. The study results indicate that meaningful historic places evoked special attention from the participants, and that those who have lived in the community longer tended to contribute more to the community heritage effort. Participants utilized social features as a way of learning local history, reflecting personal experiences and stories, and co-creating rich layers of local history information from their perspectives.

Two factors that may have an influence on such interactions are cultural differences between individuals in highly multicultural workplaces, and the layout and physical spaces of the workplace itself. In this work, we investigate how these two factors may facilitate or hinder inter-group interactions in the workplace. We analyze traces collected using wearable electronic badges to capture face-to-face interactions and mobility patterns of employees in a research laboratory in the UK. We observe that those who interact with people of different roles tend to come from collectivist cultures that value relationships and where people tend to be comfortable with social hierarchies, and that some locations in particular are more likely to host serendipitous interactions, knowledge that could be used by organizations to enhance communication and productivity.",

We organize our analysis around a basic question: given all the connections among a person's friends, can you recognize his or her romantic partner from the network structure alone? Using data from a large sample of Facebook users, we find this task can be accomplished with high accuracy, but doing so requires the development of a new measure of tie strength that we term `dispersion' --- the extent to which two people's mutual friends are not themselves well-connected. The results offer methods for identifying particular types of structurally significant people in on-line applications, and suggest a potential expansion of existing theories of tie strength. ",

The information users share about one another can have significant impacts on impression formation, and at times this other-generated content may be face threatening, or challenging to one's desired self-presentation. However, we know little about the nature of these other-generated face threats and the ways that people perceive them. Using an online survey of 150 Facebook users, we report on what these users consider to be other-generated face threats and how they feel after experiencing them. Results suggest that many face threats result from other Facebook users neglecting or misunderstanding a target's audience and/or self-presentation goals, as well as a target's fear of creating an unwanted association with another Facebook user. Experience of these threats is affected by both individual and situational attributes. We also report on a new unique measure capturing Facebook skills.",

Whether or not they will eventually replace books or merely complement them, there is a concern that something important might be lost in moving from print to digital books. While there is a wealth of research into the challenges and opportunities of e-reading, there is little research aiming to understand the broader role of books in everyday life. Rather than speculating on what books are in the digital age, in this paper, we wish to ask what books do. To do so, we conducted a series of in-depth interviews with ten UK households to understand everyday uses of books. Our findings suggest that books are not merely reading technologies but a resource for everyday social and personal engagements. We discuss implications of re-framing books as social technologies for the design of e-books. ",

Founders' human and social capital before the group was formed, the decisions they made when they created the group and their behavior in the group during its first week all predicted group survival. Many of the results suggest that founders create more successful groups if they have more resources (e.g., more online friends) and opportunities for acquiring relevant skills (e.g., more experience with online groups) and are more active in their group.  However, founders who are too controlling seem to present a threat their groups.  Their groups are more likely to fail if they are the only group administrator, if they have ties to all group members and if they added everyone to the group.",

In this paper we use empirical data to explore how this promise plays out in the everyday tasks of clinicians. Building on CSCW literature that suggests that the accounting functions of EMR are impinging on coordination of work, we draw on new institutionalism to outline how certain institutional logics around safety are shaping experiences of EMR in-situ. We suggest that institutionalized logics of U.S. healthcare are embedded in the EMR design itself, structuring how \"safety\" is achieved and evaluated. Using over one year of ethnographic research in an obstetrical unit, we find that the institutional logics of \"safety\" embedded in the EMR create negative organizational outcomes, undermining coordination and necessitating inaccurate accounts of work. We provide design implications to address these issues in the current institutional environment and envision how systems might be designed to promote alternate logics of safety that are social, dynamic, and cast humans as expert agents.",

Crowdsourcing could help this process through on-demand harnessing of flexible and powerful human cognition, but incurs other challenges including limited attention and expertise. Further, text data can be complex, high-dimensional, and ill-structured. We address two major challenges unsolved in prior crowd clustering work: scaffolding expertise for novice crowd workers, and creating consistent and accurate categories when each worker only sees a small portion of the data. To address these challenges we present an empirical study of a two-stage approach to enable crowds to create an accurate and useful overview of a dataset: A) we draw on cognitive theory to assess how re-representing data can shorten and focus on salient dimensions; and B) introduce an iterative clustering approach that provides workers a global overview of data. We demonstrate a classification-plus-context approach elicits the most accurate categories at the most useful level of abstraction.",

We present qualitative and quantitative evidence that demonstrates the descriptive adequacy of a model of triadic interaction in triple space. We use that model to argue that the notion of good-enoughness is not a group attribute, but rather tied to each dyadic pair. This intellectual framework allows us to examine how non-response operates within these triple-space interactions when interaction is supported by different media.   The results related to non-response raise the possibility that different media may result in subtle changes influences on the balance of participant goals. ",

        "abstract": "Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter--where entrepreneurs and artists look to the internet for funding--have quickly risen to prominence. However, we know very little about the factors driving the \"crowd\" to take projects to their funding goal. In this paper we explore the factors which lead to successfully funding a crowdfunding project. We study a corpus of 45K crowdfunded projects, analyzing 9M phrases and 59 other variables commonly present on crowdfunding sites. The language used in the project has surprising predictive power--accounting for 58.56% of the variance around successful funding. A closer look at the phrases shows they exhibit general persuasion principles. For example, also receive two reflects the principle of Reciprocity and is a top predictor of successful funding. We conclude this paper by announcing the release of the predictive phrases and the control variables as a public dataset, hoping that our work can enable new features on crowdfunding sites--tools to help both backers and project creators make the best use of their time and money.",

        "abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) rely primarily on discussion forums for interaction among students. We investigate how forum design affects student activity and learning outcomes through a field experiment with 1101 participants on the edX platform. We introduce a reputation system, which gives students points for making useful posts. We show that, as in other settings, use of forums in MOOCs is correlated with better grades and higher retention. Reputation systems additionally produce faster response times and larger numbers of responses per post, as well as differences in how students ask questions. However, reputation systems have no significant impact on grades, retention, or the students' subjective sense of community. This suggests that forums are essential for MOOCs, and reputation systems can improve the forum experience, but other techniques are needed to improve student outcomes and community formation. We also contribute a set of guidelines for running field experiments on MOOCs. ",

Previous approaches of applying individual search process models directly into collaborative setting have also be identified as problematic. In this paper, we proposed an innovative approach to model collaborative search process using Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which is an automatic technique for analyzing temporal sequential data. Obtained through a user study, the data used in this paper consist of two different tasks in both collaborative exploratory Web search and individual exploratory Web search conditions. Our results show that the identified hidden patterns of search process through HMM are compatible with previous well-known models. Besides, HMM has the benefit of providing more details than previous models. It generates richer and more detailed information on search process, which was demonstrated in our study to be useful for analyzing task differences and the correlation of search process with search performance.

With the emergence and popularity growth of social Q&A platforms such as StackExchange, this is beginning to change. Such platforms offer different socio-technical incentives to their participants than mailing lists do, e.g., rich web environments to store and manage content collaboratively, or a place to showcase their expertise more visibly to potential recruiters. However, one of the fundamental differences between StackExchange and mailing lists is gamification, i.e., participants compete to obtain reputation points and badges. Using a case study of R, a popular data analysis software, we investigate how mailing list participation has evolved since the launch of StackExchange. We found that mailing list experts are migrating to StackExchange, and their behavior is influenced by gamification: participants active on both are more active and provide faster answers on StackExchange than on the mailing list, suggesting they are motivated by the game.",

We studied two fundamental issues for such sites: flow of information (via repinning) and patterns of activity that attract followers. We organized our studies around two key factors: the extent to which users specialize in particular topics, and homophily among users. We also considered the existence of differences between female and male users. We found: (a) women and men differed in the types of content they collected and the degree to which they specialized; male Pinterest users were not particularly interested in stereotypically male topics; (b) sharing diverse types of content increases your following, but only up to a certain point; (c) homophily drives repinning: people repin content from other users who share their interests; homophily also affects following, but to a lesser extent. Our findings suggest strategies both for users (e.g., strategies to attract an audience) and maintainers (e.g., content recommendation methods) of social curation sites.",

Game characters and avatars are a mediated form of self-representation for the player, but some research suggests that players also view characters in other ways that have to do with the kinds of value that the characters provide. To better understand the ways that players value their characters in an online environment, we carried out a semi-structured interview study of twenty World of Warcraft players. From our data we identify ten kinds of value that characters can provide - including utility, investment, communication, memory, enjoyment, and representations of relationships, as well as value as an opportunity for experience, creativity, sociability, and self-expression. The analytical lens of value provides a new understanding of the ways that players appreciate characters in online multi-user worlds. Our results can help developers understand and enhance an element of multi-player games that contributes greatly to player experience and satisfaction. ",

We mined large-scale social media use in an enterprise to examine: a) user roles with such broad platforms and b) whether people with large social networks are highly regarded. First, a factor analysis revealed that most variance of social media usage is explained by commenting and 'liking' behaviors while other usage can be characterized as patterns of distinct tool usage. These results informed the development of a model showing that online network size interacts with other media usage to predict who is highly assessed in the organization. We discovered that the smaller one's online network size in the organization, the more highly assessed they were by colleagues. We explain this inverse relationship as due to friending behavior being highly visible but not yet valued in the organization.",

Findings reveal that multi-people households that engage in account sharing face several challenges, including presenting multiple people in one profile, coordinating negotiations over access to domestic space, and representing in a fair way the reputation hosts have accumulated together over time. Amidst the rising rhetoric of a 'reputation economy', this paper calls for engaging the inclusions, exclusions, and inequalities that reputation metrics may renew or create, especially if they fail to acknowledge people's account sharing practices. Furthermore, this paper encourages adopting a design focus beyond individuals in order to cater to maintaining shared accounts and interacting with others through them. The findings have implications for a variety of hospitality exchange services and other online systems.",

Speech-language pathologists have highlighted that effective parent participation in everyday parent-child conversation is important to treat children's language delay. For effective roles, however, parents need to alter their own lifelong-established conversation habits, requiring extensive period of conscious effort and staying alert. In this paper, we present new opportunities for mobile and social computing to reinforce everyday parent-child conversation with therapeutic implications for children with language delays. Specifically, we propose TalkBetter, a mobile in-situ intervention service to help parents in daily parent-child conversations through real-time meta-linguistic analysis of ongoing conversations. Through extensive field studies with speech-language pathologists and parents, we report the multilateral motivations and implications of TalkBetter.

Drawing on these insights, we go on to present a novel, portable, wireless 3D modeling system that emphasizes 'quick and dirty' capture. We discuss its design rational in relation to our field observations and evaluate this rationale further by giving the system to archaeological experts to explore in a variety of settings. While our device compromises on the resolution of traditional 3D scanners, its support of interpretation through emphasis on real-time capture, review and manipulability suggests it could be a valuable tool for the future of archaeology.",

        "abstract": "Leaders are important for the smooth functioning of teams but their effect on team performance is less well established. Based on a sample of 55 software development teams from two companies we examined the association between technical leaders' communication structure and the team's performance. Consistent with past research, we found that a team's productivity and quality improve when the team communication follows hierarchical and small-world patterns, respectively. However, there was significant additional improvement in both productivity and quality when technical leaders shared more information than they gathered, and when they were more central in the communication network. Surprisingly they were not necessarily the most \"central\" individuals in the team's communication structure. We discuss the implication of these results for new tools that provide feedback to leaders and the team.",

        "abstract": "Guided by the underlying question of how--if at all--the self-disclosure process varies online, the present study explores the self-disclosure practices of 26 American graduate students on Facebook through in-depth interviews. Building on work by Derlega and Grzelak [13] on self-disclosure goals and focusing on the affordances of the site, findings reveal both commonalities with and extensions to existing communication research on self-disclosure, as users see both benefits and drawbacks to the high visibility and persistence of content shared through the site. Furthermore, users employed a wide spectrum of strategies to help them achieve their disclosure goals while decreasing perceived risks associated with making disclosures in a public forum. Importantly, these strategies generally sought to recreate the offline boundaries removed by the technical structure of the site and allow users to engage in a more strategic disclosure process with their network.

We conducted an in situ study of Facebook and face-to-face interactions examining how they influence people's mood in the workplace. Thirty-two participants in an organization were each observed for five days in their natural work environment using automated data capture and self-report measures. Our results show that online and offline social interactions are associated with different mood experiences, suggesting that they serve different purposes at work. Face-to-face interactions are associated with a happy mood throughout the day whereas Facebook use and being engaged in work contribute to an overall positive feeling at the end of the day. Email use is associated with negative affect and along with multi-tasking, it is associated with a feeling of engagement and challenge throughout the day. This is the first study that examined how offline and online social interactions influence mood in the workplace.",

But many growing areas of CSCW work, including mobile, cloud, and social computing, run into problems at precisely this intersection. This paper presents a model for understanding processes of change and emergence in social computing in which policy, practice, and design show up in the form of complex interdependencies, or knots, which collectively determine the shape, meaning and trajectory of shifting computational forms. We then apply this model to the recent controversy over the location-aware mobile app Girls Around Me, which, when examined with an eye for policy's interaction with design and users, turns out to be a multi-layered issue involving the intentions app designers, the policies of platforms like Foursquare and Facebook.  Finally, we examine policy negotiations in the case of Google Buzz and the privacy complaint issued in response by the Federal Trade Commission. ",

We leverage Facebook data shared voluntarily by 165 new mothers as streams of evidence for characterizing their postnatal experiences. We consider multiple measures including activity, social capital, emotion, and linguistic style in participants' Facebook data in pre- and postnatal periods. Our study includes detecting and predicting onset of post-partum depression (PPD). The work complements recent work on detecting and predicting significant postpartum changes in behavior, language, and affect from Twitter data. In contrast to prior studies, we gain access to ground truth on postpartum experiences via self-reports and a common psychometric instrument used to evaluate PPD. We develop a series of statistical models to predict from data available before childbirth a mother's likelihood of PPD. We corroborate our quantitative findings through interviews with a sample of the participants. We find that increased social isolation and lowered availability of social capital as manifested on Facebook, are the best predictors of PPD in mothers.",

In this paper, we investigate political disagreements on Face-book to explore the conditions under which diverse opin-ions can coexist online. Via a mixed methods approach comprising 103 survey responses and 13 interviews with politically engaged American social media users, we found that participants who perceived less homophily among their friends engaged less on Facebook than those who perceived more. Unfortunately, weak ties were particularly brittle to political disagreements, despite being the ties most likely to offer diversity. Finally, based on our findings we suggest potential design opportunities to bridge across ideological difference: 1) support exposure to weak ties; and 2) make common ground visible while friends converse.

These websites also seek to coordinate donations so that each project receives enough money to actually succeed. Each crowdfunding project sets a goal for donations required and a deadline in which to receive them. Crowdfunding site designers must decide what to do with donations to projects that don't reach their goal by the deadline. Some crowdfunding sites use an all-or-nothing return rule in which donations are returned to donors if a project doesn't met its goal. Other sites use a direct donation structure where all donations are kept by the project even if the total is insufficient.  Using a lab experiment that simulates a crowdfunding website, we find that the return rule mechanism leads to a marginal improvement in productivity, but a considerable loss in efficiency. The direct donation model, though, encourages donors to coordinate.",

Tools for annotating, organizing, and summarizing information can help, but their value will likely depend on the accuracy of teammates' information. To document this claim, two experiments examined participants' performance on a complex detective task when they asynchronously received information from a teammate in a collaboration tool or received no such information. We found that receiving a progress report containing accurate information was associated with improved performance (vs. no information shared in a tool) but worse performance when the information was inaccurate. Teammates were evaluated as helpful even when they were not. Our findings point to a phenomenon of teammate inaccuracy blindness that arises when teammates provide inaccurate information.

We identify four ways that technology helps people do this: (a) by allowing much of the practical planning work to become \"invisible;\" (b) by easing navigation through the delicate rules of family configurations made manifest in the guest list; (c) by helping create a spectacle-like event that adroitly balances excess and realism; and (d) by documenting the wedding in ways that allows re-experiencing the magic after the event.

Using statistical analyses, and qualitative coding techniques, we explore trends of and motivations for conversations on the Warby Parker Facebook page. We show that contributors produce a broad range of content, from artistically edited photo collages and self-portraits to simple \"likes\" and one-to-three word comments, and in doing so leverage the Warby Parker Facebook page as a platform for creative self-expression, and socially driven decision-making.",

We explore this approach in the context of a geographic wiki and route-planning system for bicyclists. We analyzed naturally occurring textual route feedback, finding that the feedback was rich in information such as bikeability ratings, tags and notes that are useful to improve the system's route finding and navigational assistance capabilities.

We study how this large and complex infrastructure for issuing unique biometric-based identification numbers to the 1.2 billion residents of India was aligned across various stakeholders engaged in the project. We find that the focus on 'data' kept the entire infrastructure together and working. However, this narrow focus also made the design team view the people applying for IDs as numbers whose management could be standardized. In reality, the infrastructure encountered people with differing experiences and expectations of state-issued IDs, expectations that had to be managed by agents on the ground. With our focus on the nation state as a site for studying e-infrastructure, we extend the domains in which CSCW research takes place and contribute to the theory of infrastructure building in a context where state-citizen relations are at stake.",

        "abstract": "Researchers and theorists have proposed that feelings of attachment to subgroups within a larger online community or site can increase users' loyalty to the site. They have identified two types of attachment to these groups, with distinct causes and consequences. With bond-based attachment, people feel connections to other group members, while with identity-based attachment they feel connections to the group as a whole. In two experiments we show that these feelings of attachment to subgroups do increase commitment to the larger community.  Communication with other people in a subgroup but not simple awareness of them increases attachment to the larger community. By varying how the communication is structured, between dyads or with all group members simultaneously, the experiments show that bond and identity-based attachment have different causes. But the experiments show no evidence that bond and identity attachment have different consequences. We consider both theoretical and methodological reasons why the consequences of bond-based and identity-based attachment are so similar.",

In particular, many data contribution and review practices are often accomplished \"offline\" via paper or general-purpose software like Excel. This can lead to integration challenges when attempting to implement project-specific ICT with full revision and provenance tracking. In this work, we explore some of the current challenges and opportunities in implementing ICT for managing citizen science data. Our two main contributions are: a general outline of the workflow tasks common to field-based data collection, and a novel data model for preserving provenance metadata that allows for ongoing data exchange between disparate technical systems and participant skill levels. We conclude with applications for other domains, such as professional monitoring and crisis informatics, as well as directions for future research.",

However, deictic pointing can be much more difficult in collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) than in everyday life - in some of the earliest CVE studies, researchers found that 'fragmented interactions' greatly complicated communication. In the fifteen years since these studies appeared, the technologies used in CVEs have improved substantially. What these advances mean for the problems of fragmentation and deictic gesture, however, is unclear. We conducted an observational study of deictic pointing in a CVE with techniques that may reduce fragmentation: extra-wide and third-person views, precise control over an avatar's pointing arm, and visual enhancements such as object highlighting and laser pointing. Our study shows that although pointing has come a long way, problems of fragmentation still occur, and that visual and view enhancements can cause new problems for collaboration, even as they solve others. Surprisingly, the visibility of preparatory actions of a gesture remained important, even when augmented pointing techniques were used.",

Collectively drawing on 15 months of ethnographic fieldwork, 156 interviews, and archival research, we find that breakdown and repair are not processes that designers can effectively script ahead of time; instead, they emerge in everyday practice. These practices are shaped by material, infrastructural, gendered, political, and socioeconomic factors - such as manufacturing limitations, access to repair parts and expertise, and environmental convictions - which designers often did not, and in fact may not have been able to, anticipate. We call the material realities and practices of repair negotiated endurance, which is illustrated by four themes from our findings: the cultural emergence of breakdown, collaborative definitions of worth, the fraught nature of collaborative expertise, and the gendered stakes of repair.",

At the same time, many participants also reported experiences of fatigue, socio-cultural tensions and concerns about maintaining a sense of personal privacy. These experiences highlight how transnational practices complicate context collapse, where the geographic dispersal of participants' personal networks renders visible conflicts of \"flattened\" online networks. Our findings also suggest a kind of technology-enabled code-switching, where transnational migrants leverage social media to perform identities that alternate between communities, nationalities and geographies. This analysis informs HCI research on transnationalism and technological practices, as well as the complexities of online identity work in terms of shifting social and spatial contexts.",

Instead, we explore how online communities (a) combine multiple social tools, and (b) use social tools together with external tools. Based on interviews with community leaders and quantitative analysis of 128 online community spaces, we explored the combined use of six social software tools--wikis, blogs, forums, social bookmarks, social file repositories, and task-management tools. Our contributions involve characterizing combined technology use by communities and adding to our understanding of online community behaviors: Communities combine social tools to create complex information spaces. When combined, each tool is used for restricted 'core' functions. Thus, \"social\" features are not always leveraged for every tool. Our results suggest that an important overlooked aspect of social media concerns how these different tools can be effectively combined. While most prior work on communities emphasizes end user content, we identify additional important design activities where community leaders curate and combine pre-existing content from multiple tools to serve their community needs.",

We show an association between adolescent moral judgment and online behavior, and we illustrate how parenting style and mediation strategies influence the teen's moral growth and decision making about online behaviors. We also note that parental mediation strategies are moderated by parents' digital literacy: reduced digital literacy is associated with more restrictive or indulgent strategies; while more digitally competent parents are more likely to monitor and mediate their teen's behaviors as they engage online. We also found that experience, not restriction, facilitates the teen's moral growth.",

Tabletop scenarios, for example, can increase the transparency of the advisory process for customers. However, we have also had the experience that the relationship quality as experienced by customers can suffer severely when IT-artifacts are introduced. Based on these experiences, we developed guidelines for both, the artifact design itself as well as for the environment in order to avoid this effect, and implemented them in one of our prototypes. The evaluation reveals that these measures proved to be effective. With the reported study, we seek to enhance our design knowledge of IT-supported advisory scenarios with a special focus on relationship building. In a larger context, we argue that the use of IT during sensitive face-to-face encounters will be of growing significance in the future but, as yet, is hardly understood.

We found that the successful appropriation of collaborative IT relies on the invisible work conducted by those people within groups who formally or informally aid their colleagues in the successful 'cultivation' of practices and sensemaking around technology--people we call shepherds.

Other players can then visit the locations to collect and view the records. A user study revealed that location can provide a rich foundation for storytelling activities.

English sentences with poor grammar can result from both a partner's lack of fluency and errors in the MT process. We hypothesize that partners' attributions about the source of the errors affects their collaboration experience. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which monolingual native English speaking participants collaborated with bilingual native-Mandarin speakers on a map navigation task. Participants were randomly assigned into a 2 (beliefs about MT: absence vs. presence) by 2 (actual mediation of MT: absence vs. presence) experiment design. Beliefs about presence of MT significantly impacted the collaboration experience, opening new opportunities for both research and design around MT-mediated collaborations.",

Our results suggest that  those who are less depressed are more structurally integrated into the TrevorSpace social graph than those with more depression.

        "abstract": "Participatory sensing systems (PSS) require frequent injection of information that has a short shelf-life. The use of crowds to gather information for PSS is therefore particularly challenging. In this study, we explore the impact of two policies on user contributions. A quid-pro-quo policy exchanges contributions from users for access to critical information in the system. A request policy simply reminds the user that information is needed to make the system function well. Prior research has shown that in these policies are effective in non-PSS systems. During a large-scale experimental study within a publicly deployed, crowdsourced, transit information system, we analyzed these policies over a 10- month period. Our results confirmed that quid-pro-quo led to more contribution, but at a cost of faster departure from the study. Simply asking for contributions largely ineffective and was statistically indistinguishable to the control condition. Thus crowdsource system designers should consider imposing quid-pro-quo type policies for PSS that concentrate on fewer users, but makes them more productive.",

We present findings from a laboratory study that examined 82 participants' SMQA behaviors in the broader context of online information seeking. When given the option of using a search engine and/or a social network, we found that participants leveraged SMQA for 20% of their information needs, most often posing a question to their network in addition to issuing a query. We show the important roles played by the specificity of the information need and the perceived audience of a given network on routing decisions. We then demonstrate that information needs and routing decisions have varied effects on participants' satisfaction, information value, and trust of outcomes. In addition to highlighting the complementary benefits and disadvantages of search and SMQA, our findings suggest that search engines can better address a proportion of people's information needs by integrating SMQA capabilities into their systems.",

This is in contrast to most of the families studied in CSCW, who are urban/suburban, white-collar and often dual-income, where the goal is to balance separate spheres of home and work. We analyze these farm families' coordination along three dimensions - space, time, and roles - and then contrast their experiences to what is known in CSCW about families who separate home and work. Through this, we reveal blind spots in CSCW's study of and support for family coordination, and suggest a new approach to building better tools to support such activities. We emphasize the importance of considering co-location rather than assuming geographic distribution across life sphere, the value of natural rhythms in understanding and supporting family life, and show how taking on simultaneous roles can be viewed as a life goal rather than a source of conflict.",

Research so far has focussed on designing ELN prototypes and learning from their limited deployments. At the same time, a variety of commercially available ELNs have been adopted by industrial and academic laboratories. That provides opportunities for situated research and a deeper understanding of the role that ELNs assumes as an integral part of a scientific environment. In this paper we present a study of ELN design that has emerged as scientists appropriated commercial off-the-shelf note-taking software and adapted it to their work. Through in-situ observations we analysed the interplay between the technology and emerging practices.  Our study revealed a tension that is intrinsic to the digital nature of ELNs: a conflict between the flexibility, fluidity, and low threshold for modifying digital records and the requirement for persistence and consistency. This led to refined requirements and design considerations for ELNs.",

We propose that a helpful intervention is to provide visual feedback about the duration of a suspended task. Results from a controlled study show significantly shorter resumption time by adding visual feedback. Further, using emotionally attachable visual objects in the visualization has the additional benefit of decreasing resumption time without increasing stress. Punishment-oriented persuasion strategies produced faster resumption, but also caused higher stress levels.

For users with high accuracy motives, the indicator promoted selection of sources that were moderately inconsistent with their existing attitudes, thus increased their exposure to attitude challenging information. The indicator, however, had little effect on users with low accuracy motives. The indicator also helped users differentiate between sources with moderate and extreme positions, and increased their tendency to agree with challenging information from sources with moderately inconsistent positions. Users with high accuracy motives were also found to learn significantly more about the arguments put forward by the opposite side with the help of the indicator.

In this work, we systematically study the link between them: we  characterise OSM users in terms of who they are, how they contribute, during what period of time, and across what geographic areas. We find strong correlations between these characteristics and national culture factors (e.g., power distance, individualism, pace of life, self expression), and well as Gross Domestic Product per capita.

The thresholds for adoption of telesurgery are mostly seen as technical, legal and financial challenges. However, the aim of this paper is to understand collaboration within distributed OR teams, which seems to be under examined in research on telesurgery. By means of a proxy-technology assessment and a series of interviews, collaborative challenges for telesurgery have been identified. These include the unfamiliarity of the remote surgeon with the practices of the local operating room team and the patient. In addition, verbal and non-verbal communication have to be mediated in a telesurgery setting, making it difficult for the remote surgeon to have an overview and stay in control during surgery. With this research, we illustrate how trust issues in distributed teams manifest in OR teams in a telesurgery setting.",

Our research explores if and how workers learn and improve their performance in a task do-main by serving as peer reviewers. Further, we investigate whether peer reviewing may be more effective in teams where the reviewers can reach consensus through discussion. An online between-subjects experiment compares the tradeoffs of reviewing versus producing work using three different organization strategies: working individually, working as an interactive team, and aggregating individuals into nominal groups. The results show that workers who review others' work perform better on subsequent tasks than workers who just produce. We also find that interactive reviewer teams outperform individual reviewers on all quality measures. However, aggregating individual reviewers into nominal groups produces better quality assessments than interactive teams, except in task domains where discussion helps overcome individual misconceptions.

Responsiveness to these requests for help is important to study because these interactions may affect users' overall satisfaction with the experience of using SNSs, signal social grooming functions essential to relationship maintenance, and affect social capital processes. In this paper, we study a corpus of public status updates posted to Facebook (N=7,466) in order to identify the pattern of responses to status updates that attempt to mobilize resources from the poster's Facebook network. Findings suggest that mobilization requests are treated differently than other kinds of posts; posts that attempt to mobilize help receive more comments than non-mobilization attempts. Additionally, responses occur more quickly and are shaped by the type of support requested (e.g., a recommendation vs. a favor). These findings help us better understand the role of help-seeking behaviors in the social capital conversion process as it unfolds via social media.",

However, in many setting, participants lack full access to others' work. Merging the theory of legitimate peripheral participation with Erickson and Kellogg's theory of social translucence we introduce the concept of practice proxies: traces of user participation in online environment that act as resources to orient newcomers towards the norms of practice. Through a combination of virtual and trace ethnography we explore how new users in two online citizen science projects engage with these traces of practice as a way of compensating for a lack of access to the process of the work itself. Our findings suggest that newcomers seek out practice proxies in the social features of the projects that highlight contextualized and specific characteristics of primary work practice.",

However, developers do not always use these tools. In this paper, we investigate a number of social factors that impact developers' adoption decisions, based on a multidisciplinary field of research called diffusion of innovations. We conducted 42 one-on-one interviews with professional software developers, and our results suggest a number of ways in which security tool adoption depends on developers' social environments and on the channels through which information about tools is communicated. For example, we found that some participants trusted developers with strong reputations on the Internet as much as they trust their colleagues for information about security tools.",

Using a large collection of game records and player-given feedback, we develop a metric, toxicity index, to identify deviant players. We then look at the effects of interacting with deviant players, including effects on retention. We find that toxic players have several significant predictive patterns, such as playing in more competitive game modes and playing with friends. We also show that toxic players drive away new players, but that experienced players are more resilient to deviant behavior.

We describe a study of an international Twitter mention network of 13 million users across over 100 countries. We show that the Gravity Model, which hypothesizes that the flow between two areas is proportional to their masses (which we approximate using internet penetration) and inversely proportional to the distance between them, is correlated (r=0.68) with the international communication flow. Using this model, along with other social, economic, and cultural variables, we predict the communication volume at Adjusted R2 of 0.80, with trade, language and racial intolerance especially impacting communication. We discuss the implications of these barriers to communication in the frameworks of collaborative work, software design, and recommendation systems.",

Findings from a survey of adult Facebook users (N=415) indicates that geographically distant Facebook Friends, as well as those who rely on the site as their primary form of communication, engage in relationship maintenance strategies through the site to a greater extent and perceive the site to have a more positive impact on the quality of their relationship.",

The core innovation of AskSheet is the capability to prioritize the inputs to enable the crowd to focus on the details that impact the end result most.  This can be viewed as an adaptation of individual information seeking behavior to crowds.  The prioritization algorithms use a probabilistic analysis of the spreadsheet formulas to calculate value of information for each of the inputs.

Controlling for common factors, such as the work's popularity, we show that the probability of reuse depends on (a) the degree of derivativity of the work in question, (b) the specific ways in which it derives meaning from other works (intertextuality), (c) the audience's preferential attachment to authors of high fecundity, and (d) the author's social embededness in networks of reuse.

Examination of differences across experts revealed that the most highly rated group of experts responded to 69% of the questions with a median response time of 16 minutes, twice as fast as other experts.

While many studies have examined the effects of avatar attributes on users' behaviors and attitudes, few have explicitly tested how elements of avatar design relate to group collaboration satisfaction.  The present study fills this gap using data from a field study with student groups in a collaborative virtual environment.  Avatar customization count was found to relate to more satisfaction with group collaboration, as did the extent to which the user expressed personal identity through the avatar.  Although other types of connections to avatars were not found to relate to group collaboration satisfaction, they did relate to avatar face similarity, suggesting that these constructs may be important to other elements of avatar use besides group collaboration. These findings also suggest that virtual group collaboration environments could improve satisfaction by encouraging users to customize their avatars, especially to reflect personal identity. ",

While almost all crowd-powered approaches account for noise in the work of individual workers, few factor in active attacks on the system. We analyze different forms of threats from individuals and groups of workers to extract information from crowd-powered systems and to manipulate outcomes. Via a set of studies performed on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform, we demonstrate the viability of these threats. We show that the current system is vulnerable to coordinated attacks on a task based on the requests of another and that a significant portion of Mechanical Turk workers are willing to contribute to an attack.

Under such conditions, plans and planning assume a central role and challenge. Plans bridge and coordinate rhythms and events emanating from the organizational, infrastructural, biographical and phenomenal dimensions of collaborative life. Plans align rhythms embedded in local practice with those operating at larger institutional levels, and establish shared temporal baselines around which local choice and action may be calibrated. This paper develops these arguments through ethnographic study of the Ocean Observing Initiative, a prominent U.S.-based large-scale long-term collaborative research program in the ocean sciences. We emphasize the intersection between rhythms and plans at two crucial moments: formation ('plans-in-the-making'), and enactment ('plans-in-action') across complex fields of practice. Our findings hold important implications for CSCW research and practice around scientific and large-scale collaborative efforts, and for federal science policies meant to support productive forms of cooperation and discovery.",

We found that these sites are not only places for building a historical resource, but simultaneously serve as opportunities for public memorialization and familial identity construction.

Students rated peersï¿½ work from their own country 3.6% higher. We found that giving students feedback about their grading bias increased subsequent accuracy. We introduce short, customizable feedback snippets that cover common issues with assignments, providing students more qualitative peer feedback.
