To solve this issue, we set out to devise a system of verification frameworks and a software tool, that are independent of specific OT algorithms and able to exhaustively cover all possible transformation cases in which puzzles (if any) will manifest themselves. With the support of these tools, we verified OT correctness and concluded: all puzzles, under basic data and operation models and established transformation properties, have been discovered and resolved.

In this paper, we investigate a number of social factors that impact developers' adoption decisions, based on a multidisciplinary field of research called diffusion of innovations. We conducted 42 one-on-one interviews with professional software developers, and our results suggest a number of ways in which security tool adoption depends on developers' social environments and on the channels through which information about tools is communicated.

Lag compensation techniques have been proposed to try and maintain consistency. However, these techniques do not address all of the issues that arise due to diverging states. In particular, current understanding of consistency maintenance does not indicate how to make game-critical decisions when there are divergent views, nor does it indicate how to repair inconsistencies. These two issues - decision-making and error repair - can have substantial effects on how players view the game, but there is little information about these effects. To address this shortcoming, we carried out an experiment to test the effects of different choices. Our study confirms that decision-making and error repair can have significant effects on player experience and performance, and shows that that simple consistency is often not as important as these other factors.

We then apply this model to the recent controversy over the location-aware mobile app Girls Around Me, which, when examined with an eye for policy's interaction with design and users, turns out to be a multi-layered issue involving the intentions app designers, the policies of platforms like Foursquare and Facebook.
