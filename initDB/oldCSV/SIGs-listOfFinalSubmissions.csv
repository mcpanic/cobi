Our SIG serves three purposes. First, to strengthen the text entry community by bringing text entry researchers working in the human-computer interaction, natural language processing and augmentative and alternative communication communities together in one room. Second, to promote CHI as a natural and compelling focal point for all kinds of text entry research. Third, to follow-up on and broaden the discussions that emerged from two previous text entry workshops held at CHI [3, 4] by engaging in dialog to identify obstacles for success and formalizing procedures for measuring progress in the field of text entry. \ ","1.
