This symposium presents the Open Source Development hypothesis which states that expanding the number, diversity, and disciplinary expertise of solvers focused on development challenges, by focusing on the problem&mdash; not a specific solution&mdash;will lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and relevant solutions. Grand Challenges Canada, X Prize, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Blum Center at University of California, Berkeley, and USAID&rsquo;s Office of Science and Technology are working to make this approach a reality within our institutions because we recognize that there is global talent to solve development problems, but the opportunities to apply that global talent are still very limited. These innovative programs use evidence-based analyses to frame the development challenges and then engage solver communities to help source solutions and articulate demand. Presenters will provide examples of Open Source Development templates, their successes and failures to date, and the potential futures for these exemplars. A goal of this session is to expose participants to new innovation models and allow them to get an in-depth understanding of the paradigms from their creators and practitioners.

This symposium presents the new initiative in the light of the scientific challenges and the financial constraints that researchers faced in the past when trying to respond rapidly to infectious threats. Worldwide human populations are under threat from newly emerging and drug-resistant infectious epidemics that are not only spreading faster but also appearing more frequently than ever before. An emerging epidemic or appearance of a new type of drug-resistant infection can strike anywhere, anytime in the world. In addition to being a major threat to public health, such epidemics are a severe burden on the global economy. Researchers are thus faced with unprecedented expectations from politicians and the public to rapidly find comprehensive, global, and flexible approaches to treating, containing, and controlling such epidemics. The development of effective responses is beyond the capacity of any single country. Global challenges need global solutions, and research funders play a key role in facilitating international cooperation by providing targeted financial support quickly.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Columbus IJ","Title":"48 Hours To Save the World: Challenge of the Next Pandemic","Topics":"\"1_Global Perspectives and Issues\",\"2_Health and Pharmaceutical Science\",\"3_Behavioral and Social Sciences\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"ay+zgD/bMMcgQBQGcpGBxA"},

Both direct effects via constituents of air contaminants translocated to the brain and indirect effects via induction of systemic acute phase responses have to be considered. In addition, epidemiological studies have now begun to report associations of traffic- and combustion-related air pollutants with cognitive deficits in children, including autism.

In the U.S., despite the limited support in this area, non-hierarchical structures have helped some women to succeed but nearly half of trained engineers find the workplace culture a deterrent. Many countries have a long way to go before an equitable framework is in place; for example, some developed nations have job advertisements specifying being male as a requirement. In this session, we will examine advances arising from gender and sex differences essential for serving everyone&rsquo;s needs, effective measures for improving workplace climate for greater retention, and thoughts about how to help ensure women received the recognition and promotions they are due.

Decades of framing the issue as a &ldquo;pipeline problem&rdquo; have focused attention on supply-side solutions such as increasing the numbers of Ph.D.s awarded to scientists from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds. While this approach has resulted in modest improvements in the overall number of underrepresented minority Ph.D.s, participation of underrepresented minority scientists in the research workforce and professoriate still do not reflect the pool of qualified, highly skilled scientists. These disparities highlight the need for new insights and approaches. This symposium draws on: &nbsp;New research comparing and contrasting the career development and choices of recent Ph.D. scientists from underrepresented minority and majority backgrounds; theory-driven interventions at the graduate level to offset the continuing challenges faced by highly underrepresented groups; and novel strategies to build and sustain inclusive research communities.

During the process of developing these assessments, a number of new analyses have been completed that have helped resolve old issues but some have uncovered new scientific challenges. There are many indicators of a changing climate. These changes in climate and the projections of further changes over the coming decades present major challenges for society. The process of completing these assessments offers a unique opportunity to identify new scientific challenges to advance our understanding of this major societal challenge. This session will look at what we have learned, examine where the science is heading, and discuss the major issues where new scientific advances are needed.

Recent studies show that the complexity of cities can be studied as mathematical and scientific analyses. Some features show remarkable likenesses between cities of different sizes, and may be expressed as &ldquo;superlinear&rdquo; equations, showing an exponential growth of social interaction, production, and creativity as cities grow larger. However, these interrelations are often overlooked, leading to less than ideal and sometimes counterproductive plans, policies, and measures.

Toward this end, President Obama&rsquo;s Executive Order 13636 calls for adopting and implementing risk-based standards to identify high-risk infrastructure and select alternatives for cyber risk mitigation. What does it mean for a standard to be &ldquo;risk-based&rdquo;?&nbsp; Risk is traditionally defined as a triplet consisting of what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, and the consequences of it happening. However, traditional approaches to risk analysis are insufficient given the rapid pace of evolution and the unprecedented uncertainty inherent in cyber threats. This symposium brings together government officials and technology industry representatives responsible for standard development and scientists studying risk-based standards.

Longer life spans are contributing to aging on a global scale. Population aging is unprecedented, pervasive, and projected to endure such that by 2050, for the first time in history, the proportion of adults over the age of 60 is expected to match the number of people who are younger than 15 years of age (with 21percent for each segment of the population). These trends create challenges for virtually every facet of human life, including health, families, work, and civic engagement. It is critical to discover the scientific principles underlying resilient aging and ways to translate these principles so that successful aging becomes the typical, rather than the exceptional, case. This interdisciplinary symposium considers a broad array of factors that promote resilient aging, within each domain addressing: What is known about the pathways to aging well? What are the critical outcomes that provide evidence for resilience? &nbsp;Where is the untapped potential for translational intervention, and at what point in the lifespan?","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Grand Ballroom A","Title":"The Science of Resilient Aging","Topics":"\"1_Behavioral and Social Sciences\",\"2_Health and Pharmaceutical Science\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"uYQdFYfPRRHnODEwpqWHwA"},

Specifically, there is a growing body of scientific understanding accompanied by a political realization that many of the pollutants currently under the air quality umbrella could be targeted for quick action to achieve near-term climate goals. There are, however, a number of complexities in addressing air quality and climate change in an integrated way, in addition to the difficulty of comparing long-lived greenhouse gases with short-lived pollutants. Thorough scientific evaluation of trade-offs and co-benefits of such policies and the economic and political implications of such integration at the various levels of governance are needed prior to large-scale action. The recent establishment of the high-profile Climate and Clean Air Coalition has sought to bring this discussion out of the academic sphere and into the political arena. However, if too much emphasis is put on quick wins for climate, air quality could be neglected, or actions detrimental to air quality could be taken. This symposium will present an overview of the current state-of-the-science with respect to climate forcing air pollutants.

These weather events have included hurricanes, tornados, extreme temperatures, persistent regional droughts, and the warmest year yet recorded in the contiguous 48 states of the U.S. Concurrently with these disruptive weather events, the Arctic region continues to warm and lose ice and snow cover. Among other effects, this loss increases high latitude absorption of incoming solar radiation, which in turn increases temperatures, contributes to further ice and snow melting, and increases release of carbon dioxide and methane from formerly frozen permafrost. This transition from a white to a blue Arctic is reflected in high latitude warming two to three times greater than the global average. Although geographically remote, these high-latitude changes are causally linked to mid-latitude weather. Likely impacts include, for example, threats to freshwater availability in the U.S., Russia, and elsewhere, which in turn impacts industry and agriculture, one effect being grain price increases that contribute to instabilities in the Middle East.

A central consideration is how to link scientific research to innovation and economic growth, and some issue-driven R&amp;D strategies are already being examined. This new emphasis highlights some major problems that do not arise with traditional discipline-driven R&amp;D, e.g., immaturity in the methodology used to identify societal issues, to make national STI policies, and to develop R&amp;D strategy through a rational and objective process. Moreover, there is a concern about the autonomy of scientific research. If R&amp;D themes are identified and transferred to researchers as a top-down policy by decision-makers, the motivation for research might be diminished. The importance of scientists&rsquo; normative conduct also needs to be considered, especially for those who work on complex and uncertain issues that might involve political decision-making. This session presents an overview of the status of issue-driven R&amp;D strategy and shares experiences in policy formation. The discussion will include aspects such as possible measures to foster scientists&rsquo; sense of commitment in meeting social challenges, how to provide promising career paths for able young scientists, and ways to integrate bottom-up research themes raised by researchers themselves.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Water Tower","Title":"Science Policy-Making that Meets Social Challenges and Motivates Scientists","Topics":"\"1_Public Policy\",\"2_Behavioral and Social Sciences\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"qiWWsuEYA02oJ3SdWfYzwQ"},

By some estimates Africa's population may double to 2.3 billion people over the next 40 years with the transition from a rural to a predominantly urban society. Yet Africa still has 15 of the least developed nations in the world, many hundreds of millions of people remain hungry and in poverty, and food security and sustainability, health, and the possible effects of climate change are major issues. Importantly, agriculture currently employs close to 70 percent of the population with women playing the principal role, and nearly 60 percent of the world&rsquo;s available arable land is in Africa. Food production must increase if it is to feed those hungry now and the rapidly growing population. While there is no single solution, recent advances in the biosciences and new genetic technologies can contribute. New traits can be rapidly incorporated, existing crops tailored to meet new requirements, and time and costs greatly reduced. Local crops can be made higher yielding, resistant to pests and drought, and more nutritious, and provide income to small-scale farmers. The symposium discusses the role of new technologies in economic transformation, examples of new genetics research on local crops, and work to ensure human and environmental biosafety, public communication, and preparation of the young as future farmers.

Expanding nuclear capacity worldwide based on large centralized facilities (e.g., generating capacity greater than 1 gigawatt) poses challenges and risks due to the large capital outlays, potential safety issues, negative public opinion, and persistent concerns about proliferation&ndash;that is, the intentional misuse of nuclear technology and material. Small modular reactors (SMRs), defined as units with a generating capacity of less than 300 megawatts that are delivered to the site fully assembled, may represent a viable alternative to large reactors since they require smaller initial capitalization, better match existing demand for energy and capacity requirements, may be easier to site, and may engender less public opposition. This symposium evaluates the opportunities and challenges associated with SMRs. It will address the technical challenges for SMR designs, the creation of market incentives that can promote innovation and diffusion of SMRs, and the national and international policy and regulatory environments to ensure safety and proliferation resistance.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Columbus EF","Title":"Opportunities and Challenges for Nuclear Small Modular Reactors","Topics":"\"1_Energy and Renewable Resources\",\"2_Public Policy\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"eDolJ23tfh0llOfK7KBlbQ"},

Particularly in semi-arid regions, increasing temperatures and attendant changes in drought severity and drought persistence threaten the sustainability of human communities, agricultural systems, and fire-prone forests. &nbsp;Although these may appear to be exclusively contemporary problems, human communities have lived in semi-arid environments for millennia through variable climates, including droughts more severe and longer in duration than yet experienced as a result of global warming. The interplay between climate, societies, and their environments is not simple and deterministic, however. The complex relationships between social and ecological systems contain feedbacks that can amplify or suppress the impacts of climate extremes. Pioneering interdisciplinary research by archaeologists, dendrochronologists, and complex systems modelers working in the semi-arid Southwestern U.S. has begun to document these dynamic relationships over millennial timescales and across climate transitions. Food and water security, changing fire risk, deforestation, and ecosystem conversion are climate concerns of the past and the present.

Many experts are now arguing for an approach that identifies the best practical solutions to cope with hazards, in preference to what they see as a quest for increasingly accurate predictions and an unrealistic emphasis on eradicating uncertainty. The chaotic nature of seismic activity makes it impossible to predict an earthquake with sufficient time for people to leave their homes, for example. Instead, experts are moving toward long-term earthquake forecasts to assess whether buildings should be strengthened. Systems experts look at the likelihood of hazards and the balance the costs and benefits of interventions on our fundamental needs (i.e. water, health, etc.). They share calculations of how society&rsquo;s finite resources should be spent for use in policy decisions. But the systems approach, which urges action based on risk assessment, is being constrained by demands for better predictions. At the center is a gap between what we worry about and what will actually change outcomes. Bangladesh, for example, is badly affected by changing climate, and some scientists argue that instead of refining a 50-year climate forecast, efforts should focus on calculating when people should abandon their land in floods, to move seeds and tools to higher ground.

What was formerly a vast and icy desert, home only to polar bears and to people who have adapted over centuries to this hostile environment, may soon become an area for thriving economic activities. While some see their traditional way of life made impossible or a unique natural heritage endangered, others are already reaching for the treasures that were buried under Arctic sea ice and glaciers as their melting makes oil, gas, and other raw material accessible. The ice-free ocean offers a tempting shortcut for shipping routes to Asia.

Leases to explore for and potentially extract seabed minerals are being granted for hydrothermal vents, seamount crusts, and manganese nodule fields in the deep seafloor of the Western Pacific and in the international seabed area managed by the International Seabed Authority. The seafloor has long been a receptacle for terrestrial debris, waste and mine tailings. But now deep waters are warming, acidity is increasing, and in some regions oxygen is declining, compromising key provisioning and regulatory services as well as resilience of deep ecosystems. There is a growing imperative to manage the deep sea from a multi-sectorial and cross-disciplinary perspective, to safeguard the marine environment while enabling sustainable use.

This symposium explores several aspects of this issue, with a focus on smaller, often endangered languages: languages are falling silent at a higher rate than bird and mammal species are going extinct. In the meantime, linguists are exploring indigenous knowledge of remaining speakers to better understand how languages can be so different and yet function in similar brains. Function words such as, \"the\" and \"from\" are often lost in agrammatic (Broca's) aphasia; what happens when similar brain areas are affected in a speaker of a language like Navajo, that essentially lacks function words?&nbsp;Is expression easier, or is a different kind of grammatical process lost? How do the typical structures of a language change the way information is presented in a sentence?&nbsp;How different is the soundscape of a language that can distinguish words just by choosing one of five pitches for it?&nbsp;How different are sentence processing strategies in small, unwritten languages from those large, written languages that are typically studied?

Robust empirical evidence indicates that learning environments can be structured in ways that promote such higher order thinking.

This is true for all students, not just those that are already high achievers. This session updates faculty on the instructional features known to develop students&rsquo; abilities to apply their knowledge and skills in new contexts. Not only will those features be explored, they will be demonstrated within the design of the session; presentations will be kept to a minimum. Participants will be engaged through individual and small group work, will have several opportunities to practice using their new knowledge, and will receive feedback on their performance.

Given the current trends of climate change, booming human and livestock populations, and increasing demand for biofuels, the pressure on crops and croplands has never been greater. Fortunately, this challenge coincides with an unprecedented moment in science. Innovative, interdisciplinary research programs are poised to deliver knowledge and tools that can help secure food, feed, and fuel for a changing world. Genome-enabled selection can accelerate the breeding of plants adapted for climate change, modified to enhance nutrition, or tailored for more economical biofuel production. Such goals can be achieved by bringing out traits hidden in a plant's own genome&mdash;variations accumulated through evolution, inherited and modified down through the generations, though perhaps not expressed in modern varieties. Tapping this inherent, natural diversity is the key, whether through genome-wide approaches or by targeting links between specific genes and traits. This symposium explains genome-enabled selection, presenting recent advances and highlighting the maize genome. Arguably the world's most important crop, maize has another distinction: a genome exceptionally rich in natural diversity.

In addition, African-Americans and Hispanics will comprise approximately 40 percent of the US workforce. However, their representation in CS is dismal. These facts illustrate the need to place more students, particularly those of color, in the CS pipeline as early as possible and retain them through baccalaureate degrees. This effort requires a significant investment between K-12 school districts, higher education, industry, and non-profits, and traditional K-12 CS approaches have been unsuccessful. Innovative approaches and programs are required that not only place students of color in the CS pipeline through engagement but also retain them through instruction. This symposium discusses the importance of cultural relevance and equity in K-12 CS education to effectively engage, instruct, retain, and graduate students of color. The panelists comprise the Partnership for Early Engagement in CS (PEECS), a partnership between Howard University, Washington, DC Public Schools (DCPS), Google, and Exploring CS.

Estimates of the number of prisoners held in such conditions in the United States are as high as 80,000. By comparison, less than 50 inmates are thought to be held in solitary confinement in Great Britain. One such prison in the U.S. is the &ldquo;super-max&rdquo; California facility, Pelican Bay State Prison, which houses more than 1,000 prisoners in 8 by10 foot concrete cells with no windows and meal delivery though a slot in the door. Although claims have been made that solitary confinement reduces crime and recidivism, the evidence for this is scant. Moreover, some clinical studies suggest that such conditions can have severe psychiatric and even neurologic consequences for the inmates. This possibility is further supported by studies of prisoners of war, sensory deprivation, and environmental enrichment, and research with laboratory animals in which behavioral assessments have been supplemented with neurobiological analyses.

Technology assessments, as a tool for policy analysis, can be used to answer specific questions about a technology&rsquo;s feasibility or effectiveness, the costs and benefits of a specific technology or technological alternatives, or present and future consequences of technological developments.&nbsp;Technology assessments in the United States were conducted at the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment from 1972 to 1995. Since 2002, U.S. Congress has directed GAO to conduct technology assessments. To date, GAO technology assessment reports include topics such as cybersecurity for critical infrastructure protection and climate engineering. This session focuses on the current status and challenges in conducting technology assessments globally. Topics discussed include the following: What is the current status of technology assessments in the U.S. and internationally? What is the role of industry, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations? How are technology assessments informing policy-makers and citizens, both in the U.S. and around the world?

The Next Generation Science Standards try to address this problem by stipulating that core ideas in science be learned through eight science and engineering practices. These reform ideas align the U.S. with other countries, but pose significant challenges for classrooms. However, there is a rich array of learning experiences outside the classroom (e.g., museums, science centers, afterschool programs), and recent reports that summarize best practices in STEM education have highlighted the role of out-of-school or informal learning for achieving success in STEM. The growing recognition that successful STEM education is achieved in communities that offer rich STEM learning opportunities outside of schools, and that youth spend less than 20 percent of their waking hours in school, presents a radical shift in thinking and may necessitate equally radical policy shifts, away from trying to &ldquo;fix schools&rdquo; and toward creating community-based opportunities for learning. This session discusses the evidence for including informal science education as a key partner in STEM education.&nbsp;Panelists will discuss the rapidly expanding infrastructure for STEM learning in afterschool programs and describe opportunities for partnerships with such settings.&nbsp;They will also describe appropriate and feasible outcomes for learning in these settings that complement and supplement school-day learning.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Columbus CD","Title":"Creating an Ecosystem for Science Learning In and Out of School","Topics":"\"1_Education and Human Resources\",\"2_Communications and Public Programs\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"fyMWardXg5oqZzr4iphjiw"},

However, regional effects of major research organizations are widely attributed to the people who work on research projects; as J. Robert Oppenheimer once said, &ldquo;the best way to send information is to wrap it up in a person.\"&nbsp;The lack of evidence about the contribution of people on project teams to discovery and innovation is largely due to the lack of data; for example, a recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) report on the biomedical workforce noted that members were &ldquo;frustrated and sometimes stymied&rdquo; by the quality of the data available. This panel describes the results of projects that have filled that gap by using data on grants to identify who is supported by research funding.&nbsp;This includes not only chief investigators but also individuals on research teams, including graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdocs.&nbsp;The data are drawn from the STAR METRICS data in the United States, the parallel ASTRA project in Australia, and HELIOS in France.&nbsp;The symposium will present results of statistical analyses that go beyond simply counting patents and publications to measure scientific productivity and explore the contributions of all members of project teams.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Columbus KL","Title":"Project Teams and Public Expenditures of Scientific Research: An International Comparison","Topics":"\"1_Behavioral and Social Sciences\",\"2_Public Policy\",\"3_Global Perspectives and Issues\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"QI2XjJ+jxptVC34I1rFLSA"},

Although focused on disease and pathogen surveillance in the continental U.S., the strategy recognizes the global importance of bio-surveillance. It is absolutely essential that nations are able to quickly detect and characterize a biological threat affecting human, animal, or agricultural health.&nbsp;This ability enables lives to be saved and improved outcomes in various scenarios, including purposeful release of a bio-threat agent, an emerging infectious disease outbreak, pandemic, environmental disaster, or food-borne illness. The ultimate goal of the U.S. bio-surveillance enterprise is the continuous collection and synergistic analysis of data from many disparate sources and the dissemination of actionable information followed by timely decision-making. This symposium discusses current U.S. and international disease surveillance approaches and the three critical challenges of improved diagnostics, predictive and epidemiological modeling, and data integration and analysis for decision support.

This has become a mantra in science education amidst shrinking budgets and limited resources. Many communities across the U.S. have addressed this by transforming the collaborations inherent in science festivals into larger STEM networks and campaigns. These initiatives often involve dozens to hundreds of collaborating organizations, across broad geographic areas, and each reaching tens of thousands of students and families. Since 2007, at least three-dozen science festival initiatives have formed in the U.S. alone, and many of these are now growing into roles that utilize broad partnerships to maximize the impact of existing resources. This symposium examines the emergence of these regional collaborations through the lens of a variety of organizational types: a science museum, a university, and a corporation. It also examines the history and impact of these collaborations and how they are maintained, and considers their future with respect to science education.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Grand Ballroom B","Title":"Science Festivals as Regional Collaborations: Extending Resources by Working Together","Topics":"\"1_Communications and Public Programs\",\"2_Education and Human Resources\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"9ue0CeyeYqffhiKjgwyf7Q"},

Our daily world is awash with examples of the benefits of X-ray crystallography. Open-access to X-ray lightsources has created a hub of innovation, bringing together industry, government, and academia from dozens of countries in the developed and developing world to focus on global challenges. Crystallography has made inroads toward the control of diseases such as HIV, influenza, and West Nile virus as well as advances toward global sustainability through energy efficient products and farming productivity. Ongoing innovations in microbeams, sample environments and preparation, and serial femtosecond crystallography continue to expand the detail scientists can get about the structure and thus properties and functions of molecules of all sizes. Crystallography has become a truly interdisciplinary field with ties to 28 Nobel Prizes and research in physics, biology, chemistry, mineralogy, geoscience and even cultural heritage.

Now modeling is being used to enhance decision-maker understanding and to inform policy for climate mitigation and adaptation. These new goals and audiences have led to innovative new methods for modeling climate, the earth system, and human actions. While such models strive for scientific accuracy, their added goal is to be useful for social learning and decision making. This symposium brings together leaders of innovative efforts to deploy state of the science models to enhance our ability to effectively deal with climate change. The models described inform policy decisions directly, serve as platforms for policy makers to consider desired outcomes, and facilitate public participation and deliberation. The panelists will overview the logic and goals of the models they are using and discuss how the models are shaped by the contexts in which they are deployed. They will reflect on the challenges to the modeling craft that arise in these contexts as well as the processes by which the public and political elites engage with models.

Stunting, a severe form of malnutrition characterized by low height-for-age, presents a major hurdle to development efforts. Stunted children have reduced productivity and lifetime earnings, and are faced with increased risk of infectious diseases and greater likelihood of poor school performance. &nbsp;So far, development efforts have focused on increasing agriculture productivity, income, and food supply in order to reduce stunting; these efforts, while effective, only provides about 25 percent of the solution. Areas that have been ignored in development practices and policies offer an opportunity to solve the problem of stunting. This session explores three key interrelated factors that directly or indirectly affect nutritional outcomes based on new emerging scientific evidence:&nbsp; water, sanitation and hygiene; gut microbiome and human health; and mycotoxin/aflatoxin food contamination.

Elections are recognized as cornerstones of democracy. Yet today there are increasing calls to change our electoral systems, and criticisms of past practices are attracting more and more adherents. Ideas for reform include changes not only to the information that voters are asked to enter on their ballots, but also to the way information on ballots is combined to determine a winner. The most important properties of electoral systems, those that determine how well the winner reflects the voters&rsquo; preferences, can be formulated mathematically. So far, no electoral system free from undesirable properties has been identified, suggesting that the choice of an electoral system amounts to a trade-off of properties. This session explores the difficulty of finding and implementing a &ldquo;good&rdquo; electoral system. Even such simple desiderata as &ldquo;one-voter, one-vote&rdquo; have proven extremely difficult to achieve in practice. Mathematical study of such fairness-related properties typically finds systems that are successful on some dimensions but unsuccessful on others. Simulation or empirical study can be used to assess the frequency with which properties fail under particular electoral systems.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Grand Ballroom B","Title":"Elections Through the Lens of Mathematics","Topics":"\"1_Mathematics and Statistics\",\"2_Public Policy\",\"3_Behavioral and Social Sciences\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"1xxomzKqBAGO+1nKJ6LVtQ"},

The statistical challenges within just climatology or atmospheric chemistry or oceanography have been a focus for intense activity; however, considering the atmospheric and oceanic sciences as a whole will allow us to examine the critical aspect of interdependencies between processes. For example, in order to understand climate fully, it is essential to understand weather, atmospheric chemistry, oceans, ice, and terrestrial processes, particularly with respect to the carbon and water cycles. Biological processes and human activities are both affected by and affect climate on local (urban heat islands), regional (land use patterns), and global scales (greenhouse gas emissions), such that a comprehensive study also requires hydrology, forestry, ecology, agriculture, economics and public policy. The development of appropriate statistical models for these processes remains a challenge because of the immense difficulty of accurately capturing dynamic aspects of spatio-temporal processes, especially nonlinear and non-stationary behavior. This session discusses common statistical themes across these major scientific problems and innovations developed to address these challenges.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Columbus IJ","Title":"Statistical Methods for Large Environmental Datasets","Topics":"\"1_Mathematics and Statistics\",\"2_Environment and Ecology\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"mFcH4d7voYSwd/B08e2yZg"},

Developing a set of alternative scenarios for societal development is one way to capture and explore the uncertainty in future conditions. The climate change research community is producing a new set of five such scenarios, called Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) intended to underpin scientific studies, assessments, and policy dialogues for the next decade or more. This symposium discusses the overarching scenario framework and the main qualitative features of the five SSPs.

These challenges are exacerbated by multi-dimensional and sometimes conflicting management goals such as ecological sustainability, economic efficiency, and poverty reduction. As such, there are disagreements about the effectiveness of different fisheries management approaches, including state regulation, market-based approaches, and collective action approaches, i.e., resource users self-organize to manage fisheries resources. Historically, there has also been a tendency to advocate for one of these approaches as a panacea or silver bullet, regardless of the social, ecological, or institutional context. Emerging empirically driven scientific research on social-ecological interactions in small-scale fisheries can provide guidance regarding which sorts of interventions are most likely to be adopted and succeed. As an important first step to address this, the symposium brings together speakers representing disciplines relevant to this challenge and with different views on these issues.

For example, new magnetic systems may permit single-molecule nuclear magnetic resonance directly through magnetic sensing. This symposium brings together prominent researchers from around the world who are pioneering approaches to probe the foundations of nanoscale magnetism. The smallest length scale envisioned is the atomic scale, where the chemical sensitivity of X-rays can now be combined with the atomic-scale resolution of scanning tunneling microscopes. The largest scale is that of fundamental excitations of magnetic systems, i.e., the vortex scale, where scanning magnetic probes have now visualized a single vortex and probed its pinning dynamics from a single site that pins it in place. In between, the use of exceptionally sensitive, scanning, quantum-coherent probes of magnetic fields can pick up the magnetic field of a few protons in a molecule, or detect the fields of nearby molecules while optically trapped in a biological fluid. The advances in these techniques suggest many problems in physics, biology, and chemistry can now be solved by direct measurement of nanoscale magnetism.","Program":"Symposia","Room":"Columbus EF","Title":"Exploring the Foundations of Magnetism with New Nanoscale Probes","Topics":"\"1_Physics and Astronomy\",\"2_Nanotechnology\"","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"Aaltsvm1QuGy3IzqfFiRiQ"},

The trend of increasing risk and complexity within the biopharmaceutical industry implies that the traditional sources of financing&mdash;e.g., private and public equity&mdash;are becoming less effective because the needs and expectations of limited partners and shareholders are becoming less aligned with the new realities of biomedical innovation. The result is a push toward funding projects and strategies with clearer and more immediate payoffs, leaving the more speculative but potentially more transformative science and translational research to languish. In order to address these issues, the seemingly disparate worlds of business and finance and science and medicine must converge; new business models that provide the proper incentives for all key stakeholders to work together toward the common goal of improving biomedical innovation must be developed.

Indigenous peoples continue to be underrepresented in STEM at one-sixth of their share of the total U.S. population, despite investment of substantial resources from the public and private sectors. At the extreme, Native Hawaiians participate in STEM at rates that are almost incalculably low. An examination of K-12, informal science, and \"broader impacts\" settings in Hawai'i, suggests that national efforts (e.g. standards-based reform and agency-funded education and public outreach) have been, and are likely to continue to be, ineffective, as these efforts do not address the source of the problem. Instead, speakers suggest that the disparity is ultimately rooted in a failure of relationships. Research across these settings indicates that many current efforts fail to transmit across cultures, and that effective efforts must primarily foster authentic trust and respect between Western and Indigenous perspective-holders.

The “lay” audiences, i.e., donors, grant reviewers, policymakers, media, and the science curious public, are of tremendous importance to scientists’ work. Scientific training has not traditionally included communication skills along with research skills. Fortunately, effective strategies for speaking to, and writing for, lay audiences are not hard to grasp. This workshop will use an engaging \"Bingo\" game to explain those strategies, provide tips for mastering them, and highlight resources available for attendees to use before their next presentation.","Program":"Career Development Workshops","Room":"Grand Ballroom F","Title":"Bad Presentation Bingo:  Please Lose this Science Communication Game","Topics":null,"Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"ooZbbe2Z2c2FgGZhymm3Bw"},
