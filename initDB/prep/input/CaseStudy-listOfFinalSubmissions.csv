The widespread adoption of iOS and Android devices resulted in a radical change in the role of technology in people’s lives. And anecdotally people exclaimed about how “cool” their devices were; “I can’t go back” to what I had before and “I can’t stop talking about it—it’s so cool!” \  \ In 2010 InContext Design launched The Cool Project to understand the underlying principles which make a product “cool.” The research goal was to discover the core drivers of the cool user experience. This consumer research used qualitative research to identify seven core constructs associated with “coolness” that appeared independently of device or software or even technology product. In 2011 SAP became interested in developing a metric to measure “coolness” and in a joint research effort with InContext Design validated the constructs with business users and co-designed a cool metric. The final result is a repeatable process for measuring cool through a quick survey, the results of which provide implications to product teams on how to improve their products to increase “coolness”.  \  \ This case study outlines the process of using qualitative data to design a valid quantitative measure.  \ ","1.

The Air Force Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) was used as the context for this case study. The study employs an eclectic set of qualitative and quantitative methodologies including a literature review for secondary data on the history of Auto-GCAS, field observations, surveys, and interviews for primary data. This paper also discusses how our methodologies and methods were adapted to the limited access, and uniqueness of, the participant groups while taking advantage of emerging opportunities. We also discuss lessons learned about the required qualities of the research team, particularly those related to cultural and technical competence, political sensitivity, and trust relationship with participants.

We focus specifically on Google Consumer Surveys (GCS) and analyze a combination of log data and GCSs run by the authors to investigate how they are used, who the respondents are, and the quality of the data. We find that such microsurveys can be a great way to quickly and cheaply gather large amounts of survey data, but that there are pitfalls that user experience researchers should be aware of when using the method.","WARNING: Reference 4 is very long.
