They also provide a handy mirror in which people can check their appearance. The 12-way mirror project plays with this duality by building and testing an interactive installation that tracks people’s reflections as they look into a shop window. Three versions of the installation are compared, one with static mirrors, one with moving mirrors and one with face-tracking mirrors. These were tested over a 5 day period in the window display of an Eyewear shop on a busy commercial road in East London. Data were collected on how many people looked in the window, for how long and what they did while looking. The results show that while movement attracts people’s attention and stops them, their own reflection is most effective in keeping their interest.","1.

This project builds upon prior work that trained K-12 teachers to use investigative teaching, which in turn had a significant positive impact on the math and science proficiency of Native American and Hispanic students. The current project seeks to use Connectivist Massive Open Course (cMOOC) technology to capture and scale this professional development through the use of video, imagery, and community building in order to integrate Native American learning processes.  The overall objective is to enable Pueblo teachers to more effectively teach STEM subject matter, as measured by an increase in both teacher and student content knowledge scores.  If successful, the use of these technologies should facilitate rapid expansion of the program in all Native American reservation schools in United States, Canada, and Mexico.","1. M. Sarche and P.

For such teams to reduce this testing time and to quickly glean usability insights we leverage human performance modeling via CogTool. Our work compares CogTool’s expert user model’s task time with actual user time from lab sessions in two user studies. In these two studies CogTool’s task time estimates were statistically significantly lower when compared to lab based user times but the two task times were positively correlated. We leverage this correlation between CogTool task times and lab user times to build a predictive user model. Next, we apply this user model to rapidly evaluate two new designs without lab based user testing. Based on these results we provide recommendations for Agile UX teams to harness CogTool for enhancing user research efforts and thereby reduce the bottleneck of lab based user testing.","1.

PBO method has a 5-step research process – prediction, collection, classification, deduction and verification. Our 10 examiners, respectively, have taken photos of easily-witnessed user behaviors around each of them with their own smartphones for 7 days and we have collected and analyzed the photos. As a result, we found out 7 different patterns on how the users utilize their mobile devices. We expect such methodology to be useful in easily and quickly observing and collecting a common behavioral pattern of multiple users, providing us an opportunity to discover the users’ needs through their natural actions.

Telecare plays an important role in addressing the challenges of an ageing population. However, many people do not wear the most common form provided, the community alarm, for reasons that include the way that it looks. In the UK, a contributing factor to this problem is that manufacturers cater to telecare service providers (e.g. local authorities) and as a result, service users are not involved in design processes. This paper describes a redesign of the community alarm by a leading manufacturer, involving participatory design activities with users and the wider public, and design internships. The main innovation of the new community alarm, called BodyGuard, is that it connects with the user’s smartphone to enable it to work outside the home. We report insights and lessons learned during the innovation process, within the context of social care reforms giving people more control and choice over the services that they receive.","1.

Therefore, we proposed the use of an android as a salesperson with cognitive and affective strategies utilizing the advantages of online- and counter- selling methods. We conducted a field study to investigate whether androids could sell goods in a department store. As a result, our sales strategies worked well and the android could sell 43 sweaters that cost approximately 100 dollars each for 10 days.

This is the story of how it was developed with different ethnic groups in Kasese, Uganda, combining methods from HCI, software development, and business modeling. We created a system that is inexpensive to implement, sensitive to the Ugandan context (e.g. low incomes, unreliable power supplies and unstable Internet connections) and provides benefits to local vendors as well as added value to users and their families. Using observations, interviews and prototype evaluations with local Ugandans we studied people’s spending behaviors and then explored alternative design solutions with them. Along the way, we discovered that a micropayment system could actually add value to the user experience beyond the exchange of money for services. This case study reports on how we designed the system and the additional value it afforded users.","1. Aaen, I. Essence: Facilitating software innovation.

We then show how we worked with users to communicate the vast possibilities created when many data sources are integrated, and participated in building a new big data service.

These autonomous robotic artworks have a behavioral specificity; they tend to be perceived as living, and by some account intentional entities. To account for this behavioral specifity and how it affects the audience experience, we propose a data-driven approach to reveal specific visit patterns. Through a cluster analysis performed on visitors’ path inside an installation involving autonomous objects, we highlight four different attitudes characterized by patterns of approach or withdrawal, passive observation and exploration.
