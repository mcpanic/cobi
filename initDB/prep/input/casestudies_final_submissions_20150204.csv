They also provide a handy mirror in which people can check their appearance. The 12-way mirror project plays with this duality by building and testing an interactive installation that tracks people’s reflections as they look into a shop window. Three versions of the installation are compared, one with static mirrors, one with moving mirrors and one with face-tracking mirrors. These were tested over a 5 day period in the window display of an Eyewear shop on a busy commercial road in East London. Data were collected on how many people looked in the window, for how long and what they did while looking. The results show that while movement attracts people’s attention and stops them, their own reflection is most effective in keeping their interest.","1.

In both types of art, we observed that experts engaged with the art from multiple perspectives while exhibiting minimal movements around the art.

This project builds upon prior work that trained K-12 teachers to use investigative teaching, which in turn had a significant positive impact on the math and science proficiency of Native American and Hispanic students. The current project seeks to use Connectivist Massive Open Course (cMOOC) technology to capture and scale this professional development through the use of video, imagery, and community building in order to integrate Native American learning processes.  The overall objective is to enable Pueblo teachers to more effectively teach STEM subject matter, as measured by an increase in both teacher and student content knowledge scores.  If successful, the use of these technologies should facilitate rapid expansion of the program in all Native American reservation schools in United States, Canada, and Mexico.","1. M. Sarche and P.

For such teams to reduce this testing time and to quickly glean usability insights we leverage human performance modeling via CogTool. Our work compares CogTool’s expert user model’s task time with actual user time from lab sessions in two user studies. In these two studies CogTool’s task time estimates were statistically significantly lower when compared to lab based user times but the two task times were positively correlated. We leverage this correlation between CogTool task times and lab user times to build a predictive user model. Next, we apply this user model to rapidly evaluate two new designs without lab based user testing. Based on these results we provide recommendations for Agile UX teams to harness CogTool for enhancing user research efforts and thereby reduce the bottleneck of lab based user testing.","1.

The engineering process had to combine tangible user interface controls with state-of-the-art multitouch software fader panels in an intuitive way.

Telecare plays an important role in addressing the challenges of an ageing population. However, many people do not wear the most common form provided, the community alarm, for reasons that include the way that it looks. In the UK, a contributing factor to this problem is that manufacturers cater to telecare service providers (e.g. local authorities) and as a result, service users are not involved in design processes. This paper describes a redesign of the community alarm by a leading manufacturer, involving participatory design activities with users and the wider public, and design internships. The main innovation of the new community alarm, called BodyGuard, is that it connects with the user’s smartphone to enable it to work outside the home. We report insights and lessons learned during the innovation process, within the context of social care reforms giving people more control and choice over the services that they receive.","1.

We conducted a field study to investigate whether androids could sell goods in a department store. As a result, our sales strategies worked well and the android could sell 43 sweaters that cost approximately 100 dollars each for 10 days.

We then describe our interviews with six professionals working in content production. These interviews were conducted to verify our derived characteristics, and to collect the thoughts of these experts on the contribution of UX to future content production. Our study led us to a new research topic we call “Augmented Content,” which we believe has significant potential to provide content UX for next- generation television services.","1. Bailly, B.

This is the story of how it was developed with different ethnic groups in Kasese, Uganda, combining methods from HCI, software development, and business modeling. We created a system that is inexpensive to implement, sensitive to the Ugandan context (e.g. low incomes, unreliable power supplies and unstable Internet connections) and provides benefits to local vendors as well as added value to users and their families. Using observations, interviews and prototype evaluations with local Ugandans we studied people’s spending behaviors and then explored alternative design solutions with them. Along the way, we discovered that a micropayment system could actually add value to the user experience beyond the exchange of money for services.

Since a navigation plan is defined before the mission, only a few commands have to be activated during the mission. This allows a gestural symbolic interaction that maps commands to a set of gestures. Nevertheless, as gestures are not universal, this asks the question of choosing the proper gestures that are easy to learn memorize and perform. We propose a four step methodology for eliciting a gestural vocabulary, and apply it to this use case. The methodology consists of 4 steps: (1) collecting gestures through user creativity sessions, (2) extracting candidate gestures to build a catalogue, (3) electing the gesture vocabulary and (3) evaluating the non-ambiguity of it.

We describe our experiences and lessons learned from conducting a multi-classroom study to examine learning from an iPad math app we developed for preschool and kindergarten children. Focusing on the research experience itself, we describe six common challenges to conducting learning research with technology and young children, as well as six principles to help mitigate the challenges. This paper is intended to help others who wish to assess learning from educational games for children.","1. Blair, K. P. Learning in Critter Corral. In Proc. Interaction Design and Children 2013.

To address these needs, visual artist Francesca Samsel teamed up with experts from the areas of computer science, climate science, statistics, and perceptual science.  By engaging an artist specializing in color, we created colormaps that provide the ability to see greater detail in these high-resolution datasets.  The new colormaps applied to the POP dataset enabled scientists to see areas of interest unclear using standard colormaps.  Improvements in the perceptual range of color allowed scientists to highlight structures within specific ocean currents. Work with the COSIM team members drove development of nested colormaps which provide further detail to the scientists.","References and Citations \ [1]	Rogowitz, B., Treinsh, L., “Data Visualization: the end of the rainbow.” Spectrum, IEEE (1998) 35:12(52-59).  \ [2]	Ware, C., Information Visualization: Perception for Design.

In the digital age, such history is being captured in personal digital archives, especially in the form of email. Archival organizations have recognized the importance of email archives and often collect email when they acquire the papers of eminent donors; however they find it difficult to screen, process and provide access to email for research, due to its sheer volume. We describe the considerations we encountered with the email archives of two prominent individuals in the special collections of Stanford University Libraries. We have designed novel approaches to the challenges of (1) Reconciliation with authority records, (2) Making ""finding aids"" of the archive available to the general public, without revealing confidential information, and (3) Browsing an email archive when one may not know what exactly to look for. \  \ Our solutions have been implemented in a publicly available and open source system called ePADD. As a result, we enable donors and archival organizations to appraise, process and screen large-scale email archives, thereby unlocking the historical value embedded in them. \ ","1. Bush, V.
