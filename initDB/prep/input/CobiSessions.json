This symposium presents the Open Source Development hypothesis which states that expanding the number, diversity, and disciplinary expertise of solvers focused on development challenges, by focusing on the problem&mdash; not a specific solution&mdash;will lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and relevant solutions. Grand Challenges Canada, X Prize, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Blum Center at University of California, Berkeley, and USAID&rsquo;s Office of Science and Technology are working to make this approach a reality within our institutions because we recognize that there is global talent to solve development problems, but the opportunities to apply that global talent are still very limited. These innovative programs use evidence-based analyses to frame the development challenges and then engage solver communities to help source solutions and articulate demand. Presenters will provide examples of Open Source Development templates, their successes and failures to date, and the potential futures for these exemplars. A goal of this session is to expose participants to new innovation models and allow them to get an in-depth understanding of the paradigms from their creators and practitioners. Participants will leave the session with new insight into how they and their organizations can participate in these new innovation models for development, leading to a larger scientific community working to solve intractable development challenges.","Program":"Symposia","Title":"Grand Challenges: Science and Technology Solutions for International Development","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"1IsPuAiY/RIZbGEe5IVvKg"},
{"Key_SessionID":"6666","Note":"","Overview":"<strong>T</strong>he symposium discusses a newly launched global multi-funder initiative across the continents with the goal to coordinate and initiate research efforts addressing any new or emerging infectious epidemic within 48 hours after an outbreak. This symposium presents the new initiative in the light of the scientific challenges and the financial constraints that researchers faced in the past when trying to respond rapidly to infectious threats. Worldwide human populations are under threat from newly emerging and drug-resistant infectious epidemics that are not only spreading faster but also appearing more frequently than ever before. An emerging epidemic or appearance of a new type of drug-resistant infection can strike anywhere, anytime in the world. In addition to being a major threat to public health, such epidemics are a severe burden on the global economy. Researchers are thus faced with unprecedented expectations from politicians and the public to rapidly find comprehensive, global, and flexible approaches to treating, containing, and controlling such epidemics. The development of effective responses is beyond the capacity of any single country. Global challenges need global solutions, and research funders play a key role in facilitating international cooperation by providing targeted financial support quickly.","Program":"Symposia","Title":"48 Hours To Save the World: Challenge of the Next Pandemic","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"xUxSo399/HZWjHOtIbXysw"},

Both direct effects via constituents of air contaminants translocated to the brain and indirect effects via induction of systemic acute phase responses have to be considered. In addition, epidemiological studies have now begun to report associations of traffic- and combustion-related air pollutants with cognitive deficits in children, including autism. While our understanding of the extent of such impacts is still quite limited, these emerging highly provocative findings could suggest that air pollution has been a greatly underappreciated risk factor for neurodevelopmental and/or neurodegenerative diseases. The symposium will stimulate discussion, especially in the context of future research needs, about this rapidly emerging area of neurotoxicology, which requires a multidisciplinary approach involving expertise in the toxicology of the central nervous system, air pollution, mixtures, and nanoparticles in order to conduct appropriate risk assessment.","Program":"Symposia","Title":"Air Pollution as a Risk Factor for Central Nervous System Diseases and Disorders","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"XDGcaBu7tdoFwVFPz2vkgw"},

In the U.S., despite the limited support in this area, non-hierarchical structures have helped some women to succeed but nearly half of trained engineers find the workplace culture a deterrent. Many countries have a long way to go before an equitable framework is in place; for example, some developed nations have job advertisements specifying being male as a requirement. In this session, we will examine advances arising from gender and sex differences essential for serving everyone&rsquo;s needs, effective measures for improving workplace climate for greater retention, and thoughts about how to help ensure women received the recognition and promotions they are due.

It has also become clear that a large part of the genome, previously thought to have no significant function, is highly actively expressed as non-coding RNA. Speakers in this symposium will describe recent studies of microRNAs that can target coding RNA for destruction, and of long non-coding RNAs that can deliver regulatory proteins to genes.

The U.S., EU and other governments are calling for a strengthened position against cyber attacks. Viruses, Trojan horses, denial of service attacks, and other methods can compromise sensitive data and disrupt critical services. Toward this end, President Obama&rsquo;s Executive Order 13636 calls for adopting and implementing risk-based standards to identify high-risk infrastructure and select alternatives for cyber risk mitigation. What does it mean for a standard to be &ldquo;risk-based&rdquo;?&nbsp; Risk is traditionally defined as a triplet consisting of what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, and the consequences of it happening. However, traditional approaches to risk analysis are insufficient given the rapid pace of evolution and the unprecedented uncertainty inherent in cyber threats. This symposium brings together government officials and technology industry representatives responsible for standard development and scientists studying risk-based standards. The dynamic nature of cyber risks requires semi-quantitative methods that integrate technical data and value judgments.

{"Key_SessionID":"7010","Note":"","Overview":"Facing current global economic conditions, the science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy of many countries increasingly focuses on the contribution of research and development (R&amp;D) outcomes to address various societal issues. A central consideration is how to link scientific research to innovation and economic growth, and some issue-driven R&amp;D strategies are already being examined. This new emphasis highlights some major problems that do not arise with traditional discipline-driven R&amp;D, e.g., immaturity in the methodology used to identify societal issues, to make national STI policies, and to develop R&amp;D strategy through a rational and objective process. Moreover, there is a concern about the autonomy of scientific research. If R&amp;D themes are identified and transferred to researchers as a top-down policy by decision-makers, the motivation for research might be diminished. The importance of scientists&rsquo; normative conduct also needs to be considered, especially for those who work on complex and uncertain issues that might involve political decision-making. This session presents an overview of the status of issue-driven R&amp;D strategy and shares experiences in policy formation. The discussion will include aspects such as possible measures to foster scientists&rsquo; sense of commitment in meeting social challenges, how to provide promising career paths for able young scientists, and ways to integrate bottom-up research themes raised by researchers themselves.","Program":"Symposia","Title":"Science Policy-Making that Meets Social Challenges and Motivates Scientists","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"oL2Fm4iqzSamR4HjceSu9A"},

By some estimates Africa's population may double to 2.3 billion people over the next 40 years with the transition from a rural to a predominantly urban society. Yet Africa still has 15 of the least developed nations in the world, many hundreds of millions of people remain hungry and in poverty, and food security and sustainability, health, and the possible effects of climate change are major issues. Importantly, agriculture currently employs close to 70 percent of the population with women playing the principal role, and nearly 60 percent of the world&rsquo;s available arable land is in Africa. Food production must increase if it is to feed those hungry now and the rapidly growing population. While there is no single solution, recent advances in the biosciences and new genetic technologies can contribute. New traits can be rapidly incorporated, existing crops tailored to meet new requirements, and time and costs greatly reduced. Local crops can be made higher yielding, resistant to pests and drought, and more nutritious, and provide income to small-scale farmers. The symposium discusses the role of new technologies in economic transformation, examples of new genetics research on local crops, and work to ensure human and environmental biosafety, public communication, and preparation of the young as future farmers.

Particularly in semi-arid regions, increasing temperatures and attendant changes in drought severity and drought persistence threaten the sustainability of human communities, agricultural systems, and fire-prone forests. &nbsp;Although these may appear to be exclusively contemporary problems, human communities have lived in semi-arid environments for millennia through variable climates, including droughts more severe and longer in duration than yet experienced as a result of global warming. The interplay between climate, societies, and their environments is not simple and deterministic, however. The complex relationships between social and ecological systems contain feedbacks that can amplify or suppress the impacts of climate extremes. Pioneering interdisciplinary research by archaeologists, dendrochronologists, and complex systems modelers working in the semi-arid Southwestern U.S. has begun to document these dynamic relationships over millennial timescales and across climate transitions.

Many experts are now arguing for an approach that identifies the best practical solutions to cope with hazards, in preference to what they see as a quest for increasingly accurate predictions and an unrealistic emphasis on eradicating uncertainty. The chaotic nature of seismic activity makes it impossible to predict an earthquake with sufficient time for people to leave their homes, for example. Instead, experts are moving toward long-term earthquake forecasts to assess whether buildings should be strengthened. Systems experts look at the likelihood of hazards and the balance the costs and benefits of interventions on our fundamental needs (i.e. water, health, etc.). They share calculations of how society&rsquo;s finite resources should be spent for use in policy decisions. But the systems approach, which urges action based on risk assessment, is being constrained by demands for better predictions. At the center is a gap between what we worry about and what will actually change outcomes. Bangladesh, for example, is badly affected by changing climate, and some scientists argue that instead of refining a 50-year climate forecast, efforts should focus on calculating when people should abandon their land in floods, to move seeds and tools to higher ground.

This session focuses on how bringing together perspectives from the physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering can lead from &lsquo;Big Data&rsquo; to knowledge, and ultimately drive discovery and innovation. Applications of 'Big Data' to a variety of aspects of science and medicine will be discussed. Presentations cover topics in crowdsourcing scientific problems, the use of large scale and high-dimensional data sets to address complex problems, applications of 'Big Data' in healthcare and education, and the use of integrated computational models to derive knowledge from data.","Program":"Symposia","Title":"Unlocking the Power of Big Data by Integrating Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"DVbEr6SV2vLyL73driLAUQ"},

Fisheries historically have been a reliable resource, but have declined due to over-exploitation, other anthropogenic impacts, and unexpected ocean regime shifts. To sustain these resources, and to manage the competing impacts brought by new ocean development and environmental change, requires credible scientific information on the global movements, survival, and habitat use of valued marine species, and how all are impacted by environmental variables. Advances in acoustic and satellite telemetry and in management and visualization of large data sets are now making it possible for scientists to acquire this information. In 2008, the creation of a new global acoustic telemetry infrastructure was initiated by the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN). OTN is a worldwide partnership of researchers documenting the movements and survival of valued marine animals and linking them to oceanographic conditions. OTN deployments complement existing efforts by global partners and, through an integrated open-access data warehouse, are creating an affordable new global ocean observing system for marine animal movements. OTN also incorporates an international network of social scientists that work to define the contributions that tracking data can make to policy and management.

Looking to the horizon implies at least three different activities: looking up from a focused, discipline- or institution-based view; looking out to see what other countries are doing, especially in terms of potential STI collaboration; and looking ahead to understand trends being driven by transformational technologies at the STI frontier. The U.S. bottom-up, discipline-based system of research and development, coupled with a can-do, merit-based approach has long yielded unrivaled creativity and innovation. The excellence and size of the U.S. scientific and industrial communities meant that its scientists and institutions rarely looked outside the U.S. and rarely faced strong international competition for new ideas, infrastructure, or funding. Given the emergence of high-impact interdisciplinary fields and recent large STI investments by many nations, how can we complement and fortify the U.S. bottom-up structure within and across universities, industry, and government, and increase the ability to gather, analyze, synthesize, and share institutional, national, and global STI information?

To engage more effectively across disciplinary boundaries and at the interface of science and society, next-generation scientists must be ready to recognize the &ldquo;so what&rdquo; of their science and be equipped to share it with varied audiences using many diverse channels. However, building systemic communications capacity will require academy-wide buy-in and changes in the funding mechanisms that support graduate education. In 2013, COMPASS conducted a survey of existing communications training opportunities for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduate students and convened a workshop to explore how to systemically improve the quantity and quality of such training. This session builds upon the findings of the workshop by setting the stage for STEM graduate education at a crossroads; discussing communication capacity as a core professional component necessary in a changing workforce; introducing the challenge of scaling, including aligning expectations of core communication competencies and evaluation techniques, along with ensuring connectivity between people and institutions; and providing case studies as examples of how large-scale change might occur.

This symposium explores several aspects of this issue, with a focus on smaller, often endangered languages: languages are falling silent at a higher rate than bird and mammal species are going extinct. In the meantime, linguists are exploring indigenous knowledge of remaining speakers to better understand how languages can be so different and yet function in similar brains. Function words such as, \"the\" and \"from\" are often lost in agrammatic (Broca's) aphasia; what happens when similar brain areas are affected in a speaker of a language like Navajo, that essentially lacks function words?&nbsp;Is expression easier, or is a different kind of grammatical process lost?

New technologies, including satellites, electronic seals, integrated anti-tamper systems, new container materials, and logical itinerary analysis, provide complementary approaches. In a wirelessly connected world, there will be many opportunities to trace and track containers in the future. The session highlights recent research results that help to answer &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the box?&rdquo; without the need for manual inspection and with increased confidence in container security. It will highlight results of U.S. researchers and progress in Europe, providing inspiration on how to overcome&nbsp;drawbacks in today&rsquo;s container security systems based on scientific research.

{"Key_SessionID":"7180","Note":"","Overview":"Solitary confinement involves isolation of prisoners for up to 23 hours a day, a condition that often lasts for several years and, in some cases, for 20 years or more. Estimates of the number of prisoners held in such conditions in the United States are as high as 80,000. By comparison, less than 50 inmates are thought to be held in solitary confinement in Great Britain. One such prison in the U.S. is the &ldquo;super-max&rdquo; California facility, Pelican Bay State Prison, which houses more than 1,000 prisoners in 8 by10 foot concrete cells with no windows and meal delivery though a slot in the door. Although claims have been made that solitary confinement reduces crime and recidivism, the evidence for this is scant. Moreover, some clinical studies suggest that such conditions can have severe psychiatric and even neurologic consequences for the inmates. This possibility is further supported by studies of prisoners of war, sensory deprivation, and environmental enrichment, and research with laboratory animals in which behavioral assessments have been supplemented with neurobiological analyses. This symposium explores the use of solitary confinement in prison systems, discusses its possible impact, and raises questions about whether it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment according to the U.S. Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, and other national and international conventions and statements.","Program":"Symposia","Title":"Solitary Confinement: Legal, Clinical, and Neurobiological Perspectives","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"dQx8LaIGEk0WtBdlRNz3Lw"},

The Next Generation Science Standards try to address this problem by stipulating that core ideas in science be learned through eight science and engineering practices. These reform ideas align the U.S. with other countries, but pose significant challenges for classrooms. However, there is a rich array of learning experiences outside the classroom (e.g., museums, science centers, afterschool programs), and recent reports that summarize best practices in STEM education have highlighted the role of out-of-school or informal learning for achieving success in STEM. The growing recognition that successful STEM education is achieved in communities that offer rich STEM learning opportunities outside of schools, and that youth spend less than 20 percent of their waking hours in school, presents a radical shift in thinking and may necessitate equally radical policy shifts, away from trying to &ldquo;fix schools&rdquo; and toward creating community-based opportunities for learning.

{"Key_SessionID":"7269","Note":"","Overview":"As worldwide hunger and malnutrition concerns in the coming decades drive the global agricultural development agenda and policies, nutrition objectives must be integrated to better ensure healthy outcomes for people in developing countries. Stunting, a severe form of malnutrition characterized by low height-for-age, presents a major hurdle to development efforts. Stunted children have reduced productivity and lifetime earnings, and are faced with increased risk of infectious diseases and greater likelihood of poor school performance. &nbsp;So far, development efforts have focused on increasing agriculture productivity, income, and food supply in order to reduce stunting; these efforts, while effective, only provides about 25 percent of the solution. Areas that have been ignored in development practices and policies offer an opportunity to solve the problem of stunting. This session explores three key interrelated factors that directly or indirectly affect nutritional outcomes based on new emerging scientific evidence:&nbsp; water, sanitation and hygiene; gut microbiome and human health; and mycotoxin/aflatoxin food contamination. New innovation and discoveries in nutrition research could help direct more effective agricultural and nutrition development policies, and programs should consider these factors to better ensure improved nutrition among smallholder farm households and their communities","Program":"Symposia","Title":"Innovative and Integrated Approaches To Reducing Malnutrition","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"dHPqbm7TYV3Ud3uLl1L24Q"},

Elections are recognized as cornerstones of democracy. Yet today there are increasing calls to change our electoral systems, and criticisms of past practices are attracting more and more adherents. Ideas for reform include changes not only to the information that voters are asked to enter on their ballots, but also to the way information on ballots is combined to determine a winner. The most important properties of electoral systems, those that determine how well the winner reflects the voters&rsquo; preferences, can be formulated mathematically. So far, no electoral system free from undesirable properties has been identified, suggesting that the choice of an electoral system amounts to a trade-off of properties. This session explores the difficulty of finding and implementing a &ldquo;good&rdquo; electoral system. Even such simple desiderata as &ldquo;one-voter, one-vote&rdquo; have proven extremely difficult to achieve in practice. Mathematical study of such fairness-related properties typically finds systems that are successful on some dimensions but unsuccessful on others. Simulation or empirical study can be used to assess the frequency with which properties fail under particular electoral systems.","Program":"Symposia","Title":"Elections Through the Lens of Mathematics","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"SWwvR+a7nkuStS+EtmCE1g"},

The statistical challenges within just climatology or atmospheric chemistry or oceanography have been a focus for intense activity; however, considering the atmospheric and oceanic sciences as a whole will allow us to examine the critical aspect of interdependencies between processes. For example, in order to understand climate fully, it is essential to understand weather, atmospheric chemistry, oceans, ice, and terrestrial processes, particularly with respect to the carbon and water cycles. Biological processes and human activities are both affected by and affect climate on local (urban heat islands), regional (land use patterns), and global scales (greenhouse gas emissions), such that a comprehensive study also requires hydrology, forestry, ecology, agriculture, economics and public policy.

What policies and actions of academic campuses, national laboratories, research institutes, and local government best yield translational benefits? Can entrepreneurship be taught? Are certain entrepreneurial success factors common across a spectrum of technology fields? Will the role traditionally played by venture capital evolve or be replaced? An early-stage company can offer an exciting environment for directed scientific research, technology innovation, and career progression. Businesses with less than 100 employees represent more than 99.7 percent of all employers, employ some 50 percent of the total U.S. workforce, and provide 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually. This symposium conveys the excitement and the challenges involved in launching and driving the early growth of a new technology company. Speakers will share entrepreneurial experiences, highlighting success factors involved in progressing an innovation toward real and beneficial impact.","Program":"Seminars","Title":"Science-Driven Entrepreneurship: Determined Pursuit of Innovative Success","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"5Hn5q67o12AJ56v3WmxMvA"},
{"Key_SessionID":"7335","Note":"","Overview":"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';\">There is growing consensus that the process of translating biomedical research into effective therapeutics is broken and that the current business model for life sciences research and development (R&amp;D) is flawed. The trend of increasing risk and complexity within the biopharmaceutical industry implies that the traditional sources of financing&mdash;e.g., private and public equity&mdash;are becoming less effective because the needs and expectations of limited partners and shareholders are becoming less aligned with the new realities of biomedical innovation. The result is a push toward funding projects and strategies with clearer and more immediate payoffs, leaving the more speculative but potentially more transformative science and translational research to languish. In order to address these issues, the seemingly disparate worlds of business and finance and science and medicine must converge; new business models that provide the proper incentives for all key stakeholders to work together toward the common goal of improving biomedical innovation must be developed. This session highlights emerging ideas and concepts with this intent.<br /></span>","Program":"Seminars","Title":"New Business Models for Accelerating Biomedical Innovation","Type":null,"_disposition":"INSERT","_hash":"hoW6ZU2eVf1AYNmqVoxqzA"},
