Computers are becoming smaller and smaller, smarter and smarter. Everyone is now surrounded by many visible and invisible computers, which are all highly connected through the Internet ubiquitously. A new world of artificial intelligence is emerging. When the intelligence of human-being is expanded to his/her surroundings, condensed into a new kind of Intelligent life, the relationship between human-being and the rest of the world has been redefined. How to cross the boundaries and to enable the sustainable interaction between nature (the 1st system), human-beings (the 2nd system), artificial world (the 3rd system), and the cyber world (the 4th system), becomes an interesting proposition and merits new design. But before that, it’s necessary to rethink the anthropocentric view and even design itself. The most attractive feature of design is optimistic. What makes a human being human, lies in that one is not leading a kind of life which merely has needs to be fulfilled, but can also use his/her subjective initiative to control and conduct his/her behavior for a certain common value. Today sustainability is not only a value of ethics, but a value of surviving. How to use and encourage a new kind of HCI design, to generate sustainable behaviors and social changes, further, to redesign the commensalism of the four systems mentioned above will be the main focus of my talk.","Bo Begole","bo@begole.net","Professor Dr. Lou Yongqi is Dean of the College of Design and Innovation at Tongji University in Shanghai.

This has vastly driven convergence among different fields along with the expansion of our thoughts and behaviors. However, to provide meaningful experiences, these relational expansions and unprecedented possibilities opened up by IoT need to be founded on core human values. Furthermore, harmonious integration between technology and design is also essential. Today, I would like to talk about what must be done in order to foster the IoT as a human-centered innovation and how UX design can realize the well balanced and harmonious IoT environment.","Bo Begole","bo@begole.net","Donghoon Chang is Executive VP, Head of Design Strategy Team and UX Center in Corporate Design Center, Samsung Electronics.

Large-scale behavioral data enables researchers and practitioners to detect adverse drug reactions and interactions, to understand how information diffuses through social networks, how people browse and search for information, how individual learning strategies are related to educational outcome, etc.  Using examples from search, I will highlight how observational logs provide a rich new lens onto the diversity of searchers, tasks, and interactivity that characterize information systems today, and how experimental logs have revolutionized the way in which web-based systems are designed and evaluated.  Although logs provide a great deal of information about what people are doing, they provide little insight about why they are doing so or whether they are satisfied.  Complementary methods from observations, laboratory studies and panels are necessary to provide a more complete understanding of and support for search which is increasingly a core fabric of people’s everyday lives.  The CHI community should lead the way in shaping best practices and policy in behavioral log studies.","Bo Begole","bo@begole.net","Susan Dumais is a Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft and Deputy Managing Director of the Microsoft Research Lab in Redmond.
