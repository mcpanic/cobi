In addition to introducing basic concepts, the course will provide enough structure to help understand how the advanced material in the CHI 2014 technical program fits into the overall field. \  \ The course material begins with a brief history of the field of HCI, and a discussion of the multiple disciplines that are involved in HCI research and practice. This includes the disciplines at the historic core of HCI, such as psychology, computer science and engineering, and disciplines that more recently have been influential in HCI, such as design, library science, and entertainment.  \  \ The course will provide an overview of HCI topics, including user-centered design methods, user interface design tools, user and expert-based evaluations, information architecture, novel interactive technologies, research methods for HCI, and interaction design for diverse users and cultural contexts. Suggested readings for follow-up information will be given. \  \ The intended audience is made up of professionals in information and communication technology-related fields who have not yet had a systematic exposure to the discipline of HCI. This course often includes first-time attendees of the CHI conference.  \  \ Instructors' Background: Jonathan Lazar is a Professor of Computer and Information Sciences at Towson University, USA. He has published multiple books, including “Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction” (co-authored with Feng and Hochheiser), has published primarily on interface accessibility for people with disabilities, and he serves as the Adjunct Chair of Public Policy for SIGCHI.  \  \ Simone Barbosa is Associate Professor of Computer Science at PUC-Rio, Brazil. She has co-authored the HCI book recommended by the Brazilian Computer Society for undergraduate programs, “Interação Humano-Computador”, and has engaged in several HCI design projects with industry.. \  \ Combined, Jonathan and Simone have taught Intro to HCI classes for nearly 30 years and are both still passionate about teaching it.  \ ","Gives newcomers background in the field of HCI to make their conference experience more meaningful. Provides a framework to understand how the various topics are related to research and practice.","games, hci4d, IxSc, cultures, artIx","","","","C02","FormatComplete","Dec 19 21:04",""

Unfortunately, these methods of synthesis are poorly documented and rarely taught, and because of the pragmatic time constraints associated with working with clients, there is often no time dedicated in a statement of work to a practice of formal synthesis. As a result, raw design research data is inappropriately positioned as insight, and the value of user-centered research activities is marginalized – in fact, stakeholders may lose faith in the entire research practice, as they don’t see direct return on the investment of research activities.  \  \ Design synthesis methods can be taught, and when selectively applied, visual, diagrammatic synthesis techniques can be completed relatively quickly. During synthesis, Designers visually explore large quantities of data in an effort to find and understand hidden relationships, to extract insight, and to look at complexity in new ways. These visualizations can then be used to communicate to other members of a design team, or can be used as platforms for the creation of generative sketching or model making. The action of diagramming is a way to actively produce knowledge and meaning, and a way to provoke a process known as sensemaking.  \  \ This skills-based course will introduce various methods of synthesis as ways to translate research into meaningful insights. Course participants will learn about how to manage the complexity of gathered data, and through hands-on exercises, they will apply various synthesis methods to elicit hidden meaning in gathered data.

Participants will learn key aspects of the theory and practice of musical interface design by studying case studies and hands-on experience mainly sourced from the leading conference in this area, known as ""New Interfaces for Musical Expression""  or NIME. Advances in digital audio technologies have led to a situation where computers play a role in most music production and performance. Digital technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for the creation and manipulation of sound, however the flexibility of these new technologies implies a confusing array of choices for musical composers and performers. Some artists have faced this challenge by using computers directly to create music.  However, most would agree that the computer is not a musical instrument, in the same sense as traditional instruments, and it is natural to ask  ""how to play the computer"" using interface technology appropriate for human brains and bodies. In two eighty minute sessions we will introduce an approach to the design of musical interfaces. The first session is presented in lecture format with many video demonstrations of musical interfaces. The second session is a hands-on lab where participants will use hardware and software tools (I-CubeX, Max/MSP, Ableton Live) for prototyping their own musical interface. The course is aimed at beginners but more experienced participants will have plenty to explore. Familiarity with basic aspects of interactive media will be helpful, however there are no specific technical prerequisites.

This course will examine the wide spectrum of user interfaces available to people with disabilities, but will raise questions about the level and quality of access that these individuals enjoy. Their current user interfaces are ineffective unless the software, document, form or website they are trying to access is designed with accessibility in mind.  \ This problem has resulted in laws being passed that require accessible design, and standards and guidelines being developed that seek to educate designers and developers. But despite these efforts, people with disabilities still face daunting barriers that prevent them from accessing technology.

Evaluate whether a practical, design, or qualitative research question can be informed by an A/B test, and define the concepts and research questions involved. \ 2. Decide which experimental comparison to make, by choosing how to modify a product (or product feature) to provide two or more different versions. Key concepts include constructing experimental and control conditions, conducting randomized assignment appropriately, and avoiding common mistakes in confounding.  \ 3.  Choose and construct outcome measures – which quantitative measures or analytics to collect or analyze, in order to evaluate how these are influenced by the experimental comparison of different product versions. Key concepts include validity and reliability of measures, efficient collection of multiple measures, and common mistakes in interpreting outcome measures.  \ 4.  Use intuitive and easy-to-apply concepts from bootstrapping to estimate variability in quantitative measures, determine whether differences in quantitative measures between product versions are reliable or due to chance (statistical significance), and avoid common statistical misunderstandings.

Even though the fundamental principles of human interaction introduced in that book are still true, a lot has changed since then. The examples in the book reveal its age but more importantly, the technology of interaction has changed.  \  \ The new DOET maintains the same basic structure with the same fundamental design principles.  But new material has been added.  First, I added the role of emotion, beauty and pleasure to the original DOET’s emphasis on utility and understanding. Second, I added two chapters about the role of Design Thinking and how these principles work in the world of business. What are the constraints of the installed base, legacy products, and consumer readiness? What about time and budget? Among other things, I introduce Norman’s Law: The day the product team is assembled, it is behind schedule and over its budget. \  \ Technologies disappear, but the needs they satisfied often remain. Phonographs, slide projectors, and film have disappeared, but music, illustrated talks, and photographs still exist. Doors, water taps, and light switches may remain the same, but automobiles will drive themselves, machines are becoming more intelligent, more fully autonomous, taking over many tasks we do ourselves, anticipating our desires. And often they will get it wrong. What design rules must change? How shall we design in the 21st century? \ Reference \  \ [1]	Norman, D. A. (2013).

Biological or physiological needs include oxygen, food, water, warmth, fitness, and health. Safety needs are to feel safe and to be free from real or perceived danger. Love or social needs encompass the need for affection, and a sense of belonging to family and a circle of friends. Esteem needs include the need to feel satisfied, self-confident, and valuable; to engage in meaningful work and activities; and to continue personal development. Self-actualization refers to the need for a sense of vocation, a calling, or a cause. \  \ The second framework is based on solutions that address needs, and includes dimensions such as intended user population, technology goals, design process, and kinds of technology (e.g., mobile phones). \  \ In the course we shall mention approximately 20 and review in some detail 10 examples, a few from our own work and but mainly representing the work of others, to highlight promising technologies at levels and points in these frameworks. \  \ We shall conclude with a challenge to the audience — seize and address one of the open problems!","Demographic trends and user diversity afford exciting design opportunities and challenges.

This course will look at three key areas: how social identity is portrayed online; our changing social networks and the technologies that support them; and the role of pseudonymity in supporting privacy.","crs0161-file1.doc","crs0161-file2.pdf","crs0161-file3.docx","","","","Creators of virtual spaces have tremendous influence on the social experience of their users, including how the inhabitants present themselves and interact with each other. The interface design can determine whether we recognize each other by face or by name; it can reveal the size of a mass audience or provide the impression that one is conversing intimately with only a few. It can make words ephemeral, disappearing forever once they leave the screen, or eternal, by permanently archiving them, amassing a history of a person’s views and reactions.    \  \ As designers and users of online spaces, we need to understand how interface design affects social interaction and to think about what effects we want it to have.   \  \ In this course, we will look at three areas where interface design encounters changing social needs and mores. \  \ 1.	Identity: In text conversations, the physical cues to social identity – gender, race, attractiveness, etc. – are missing. Early cyber-utopians thought this would eliminate stereotypes.  Yet impression formation given minimal cues is more complex than they realized.  We’ll look at how interface, context and language effect perceptions of gender and race online. \  \ 2.	Social networks:  Communication technologies make it easy to stay in touch with unprecedented numbers of people.  Many decry these connections as shallow, but a closer look at how our society has evolved indicates that these may well be the very type of connections we need. What designs best support our socially and spatially mobile society? \  \ 3.	Pseudonymity and privacy:  In the physical world, space and time keep different facets of our lives separate, providing everyday privacy.  Online, search and the persistence of data collapse these contexts.  We’ll discuss when and why this is a problem.  Pseudonymity is a solution -- what designs make it work? \ ","This course uses empirical studies and design critiques to inspire designers to create radically innovative interfaces while also thoughtfully assessing the likely social impact of their designs. \ ","","Judith Donath","","","CHIndD","FormatComplete","Dec 20 22:17",""
