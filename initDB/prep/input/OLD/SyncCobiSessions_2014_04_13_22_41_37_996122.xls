This symposium presents the Open Source Development hypothesis which states that expanding the number, diversity, and disciplinary expertise of solvers focused on development challenges, by focusing on the problem&mdash; not a specific solution&mdash;will lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and relevant solutions. Grand Challenges Canada, X Prize, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Blum Center at University of California, Berkeley, and USAID&rsquo;s Office of Science and Technology are working to make this approach a reality within our institutions because we recognize that there is global talent to solve development problems, but the opportunities to apply that global talent are still very limited. These innovative programs use evidence-based analyses to frame the development challenges and then engage solver communities to help source solutions and articulate demand. Presenters will provide examples of Open Source Development templates, their successes and failures to date, and the potential futures for these exemplars. A goal of this session is to expose participants to new innovation models and allow them to get an in-depth understanding of the paradigms from their creators and practitioners. Participants will leave the session with new insight into how they and their organizations can participate in these new innovation models for development, leading to a larger scientific community working to solve intractable development challenges.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6666</td><td>48 Hours To Save the World: Challenge of the Next Pandemic</td><td><strong>T</strong>he symposium discusses a newly launched global multi-funder initiative across the continents with the goal to coordinate and initiate research efforts addressing any new or emerging infectious epidemic within 48 hours after an outbreak. This symposium presents the new initiative in the light of the scientific challenges and the financial constraints that researchers faced in the past when trying to respond rapidly to infectious threats. Worldwide human populations are under threat from newly emerging and drug-resistant infectious epidemics that are not only spreading faster but also appearing more frequently than ever before. An emerging epidemic or appearance of a new type of drug-resistant infection can strike anywhere, anytime in the world. In addition to being a major threat to public health, such epidemics are a severe burden on the global economy. Researchers are thus faced with unprecedented expectations from politicians and the public to rapidly find comprehensive, global, and flexible approaches to treating, containing, and controlling such epidemics. The development of effective responses is beyond the capacity of any single country. Global challenges need global solutions, and research funders play a key role in facilitating international cooperation by providing targeted financial support quickly.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6672</td><td>Air Pollution as a Risk Factor for Central Nervous System Diseases and Disorders</td><td>Increasing evidence suggests that adverse consequences of air pollution, a global environmental health concern, are not specific to the cardiovascular system and can target the brain to produce many of the same inflammatory and other adverse consequences documented in the lung.&nbsp;Such findings have been described in experimental models for exposures, such as the metal constituents of ultrafine particulate matter of air pollution for diesel exhaust and for ozone. Both direct effects via constituents of air contaminants translocated to the brain and indirect effects via induction of systemic acute phase responses have to be considered. In addition, epidemiological studies have now begun to report associations of traffic- and combustion-related air pollutants with cognitive deficits in children, including autism. While our understanding of the extent of such impacts is still quite limited, these emerging highly provocative findings could suggest that air pollution has been a greatly underappreciated risk factor for neurodevelopmental and/or neurodegenerative diseases. The symposium will stimulate discussion, especially in the context of future research needs, about this rapidly emerging area of neurotoxicology, which requires a multidisciplinary approach involving expertise in the toxicology of the central nervous system, air pollution, mixtures, and nanoparticles in order to conduct appropriate risk assessment.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6705</td><td>Women Poised for Discovery and Innovation: Resolving the Remaining Hurdles</td><td>

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"><span lang="EN-CA" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: 'Gill Sans MT','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-fareast-language: EN-CA;">The world and the ways of networking and collaborating on scientific projects have changed dramatically, even in the past decade. The opportunities available to women, the pathways to success, and the heights that they can reach are unlike those of previous generations. As well, today it is better recognized that there are opportunities and demands to use gender and sex in an advantageous manner for scientific discovery and engineering innovations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, extra challenges, including implicit bias and poor workplace climates, impede women from reaching their true potential and contributing fully to society. International variations are significant; some hinder progress while others help. For example, many Scandinavian countries have superb parental care and leave policies, and yet women have not reached equity. In the U.S., despite the limited support in this area, non-hierarchical structures have helped some women to succeed but nearly half of trained engineers find the workplace culture a deterrent. Many countries have a long way to go before an equitable framework is in place; for example, some developed nations have job advertisements specifying being male as a requirement. In this session, we will examine advances arising from gender and sex differences essential for serving everyone&rsquo;s needs, effective measures for improving workplace climate for greater retention, and thoughts about how to help ensure women received the recognition and promotions they are due. How can we analyze sex and gender from the start can serve as a resource to stimulate new knowledge and technologies and what can we do to get women (at all points in their careers) to reach their full potential? </span></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6709</td><td>Non-Coding RNA in Development and Disease</td><td>During the past few years, it has become clear that one type of ribonucleic acid (RNA) that does not code for protein plays central roles in epigenetic regulation. The emerging understanding is revolutionizing the way we think about the genome and how it is controlled. These RNAs are transcribed from the cell&rsquo;s DNA and perform a wide variety of gene regulatory functions, some of which were once thought to be the exclusive purview of proteins. It has also become clear that a large part of the genome, previously thought to have no significant function, is highly actively expressed as non-coding RNA. Speakers in this symposium will describe recent studies of microRNAs that can target coding RNA for destruction, and of long non-coding RNAs that can deliver regulatory proteins to genes. Proper functioning of these RNAs is critical, as loss of their expression can have profound effects on development and cell growth.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6725</td><td>Beyond the Pipeline: New Strategies to Build a Competitive and Diverse Workforce</td><td>Creating a 21<sup>st</sup> century American scientific workforce able to ensure leadership in global innovation and long-term economic competitiveness is inextricably linked to diversifying the workforce.&nbsp;Ph.D. scientists, as leaders in academia, government, and industry, are a primary leverage point where increased diversity could have a multiplicative impact. Decades of framing the issue as a &ldquo;pipeline problem&rdquo; have focused attention on supply-side solutions such as increasing the numbers of Ph.D.s awarded to scientists from underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds. While this approach has resulted in modest improvements in the overall number of underrepresented minority Ph.D.s, participation of underrepresented minority scientists in the research workforce and professoriate still do not reflect the pool of qualified, highly skilled scientists. These disparities highlight the need for new insights and approaches. This symposium draws on: &nbsp;New research comparing and contrasting the career development and choices of recent Ph.D. scientists from underrepresented minority and majority backgrounds; theory-driven interventions at the graduate level to offset the continuing challenges faced by highly underrepresented groups; and novel strategies to build and sustain inclusive research communities. This evidence-based session focuses on the individual, institutional, and systemic factors that influence the continuum of career development for Ph.D. scientists and discusses possible solutions for strengthening the workforce through diversity.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6745</td><td>Your Genome: To Share or Not To Share?</td><td>The last decade has witnessed breathtaking developments in the performance of DNA sequencing. We produce genetic information for research and clinical care at exponential rates, with some new projects aiming to sequence hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sharing these genetic datasets is crucial to understand the genetic basis of diseases, accelerate biomedical discoveries, and produce better interpretation and diagnosis. The problem is that public sharing of genetic information risks the genetic privacy of participants and their families. Multiple lines of research have shown that genetic privacy cannot be guaranteed even if the data is disseminated without identifiers. But do we really need to choose between privacy and better clinical care? This symposium will illuminate the opportunities and complexities in sharing genetic data and discuss potential cryptographic and policy mitigation schemes for this problem.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6759</td><td>What Do People Think about Science and Technology? U.S. and International Public Opinion</td><td>The public opinion environment affects countries&rsquo; ability to meet global challenges by helping to shape policymaking and individual choices such as what to study and where to invest. This symposium builds on the early 2014 release of <i>Science and Engineering Indicators 2014</i> to provide an update on the current state of public opinion about science and technology (S&amp;T) in the U.S. and around the world.&nbsp;<i>Indicators</i> is the National Science Board&rsquo;s biennial report to the U.S. Congress on S&amp;T and includes a detailed chapter on &ldquo;public attitudes and understanding.&rdquo; It uses the best available data from the U.S. and around the world to provide a portrait of what Americans think about S&amp;T in comparison to previous years and other countries. The report includes extensive reporting of data from the Pew Research Center and Gallup, both of which provide the public with extensive, ongoing public opinion data about key S&amp;T issues such as climate change, energy, and health topics. An additional primary source of data is a special section of the General Social Survey that includes questions that the National Science Foundation has fielded for more than three decades, addressing both public knowledge about basic S&amp;T and S&amp;T attitudes. The 2014 indicators also features several special sections, including one on views about scientists and engineers.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6761</td><td>Research Challenges in Climate Change: What&rsquo;s New and Where Are We Going?</td><td>

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Two new reports, the U.S. National Climate Assessment and the Working Group I Assessment Report 5 (AR5) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will be released in early 2014. These new assessments evaluate the state of the science and the major changes in findings over the last 4 to 6 years since the last assessments were released. During the process of developing these assessments, a number of new analyses have been completed that have helped resolve old issues but some have uncovered new scientific challenges. There are many indicators of a changing climate. These changes in climate and the projections of further changes over the coming decades present major challenges for society. The process of completing these assessments offers a unique opportunity to identify new scientific challenges to advance our understanding of this major societal challenge. This session will look at what we have learned, examine where the science is heading, and discuss the major issues where new scientific advances are needed. This session examines the recent changes in the science and what that tells us about the understanding of the changes occurring in climate and &nbsp;discusses the big issues the scientific community is still struggling with and what this means to the direction of the science over the next decade. The emphasis will be on new research challenges.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6765</td><td>Nexus of Cell Signaling and Drug Therapy: Oxygen, Phosphorus, Sulfur, and Nitrogen</td><td><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Times','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">To make use of oxidative metabolism as the most efficient means of metabolizing food, life forms have adapted to the toxicity of oxygen in a myriad of ways. Phosphorus, sulfur, selenium, and nitrogen can provide protection from reactive oxygen species and can also facilitate important cell signaling functions. The chemistries of sulfur (or selenium) allow for reversible oxidation/ reduction cycles that permit important control of cell functions. In addition, nitrogen and its oxides are ubiquitous in regulating many aspects of cell physiology. Phosphorus-based kinases and phosphatases regulate many pathways that control cell proliferation and gene regulation. Altered regulation of some of these pathways has been linked with various human diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders and has provided an important platform for drug discovery and development.</span></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6769</td><td>Molecular Basis of Age-Related Susceptibility to Chemicals and Environmental Hazards</td><td>The susceptibility of individuals to chemicals and environmental hazards at the extremes of the population age-distribution is often not adequately assessed. By understanding genes expressed at the various life stages, the assessment of health risk can be more rationally determined. Children and older adults may be more susceptible to chemicals compared to adults because of differences is physiology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Genetic and epigenetic changes that occur with age and chemical exposure may also alter susceptibility to chemicals. This session examines the genomic and epigenomic changes that occur with age in the rat liver and kidney. Human relevance will be addressed using data from human studies, including a longitudinal birth cohort study in Mexican-American children exposed to pesticides and a cohort of older men from the Normative Aging Study exposed to particulate matter. Ultimately, understanding the implications of genetic and epigenetic changes related to age on the effects of chemical exposure will help to better assess the impacts of environmental exposures on the health of children and older adults.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6770</td><td>STEM Education Policies and Policymaking: Pushing in the Same Direction</td><td>Pressures on postsecondary education from outside and within are complex and hard to manage. They require that we rethink what it means to be educated in today&rsquo;s world and explore ways to provide coherent, meaningful educational experiences in the face of the current turbulence, uncertainty, and fragmentation in higher education. Challenges include changing patterns of participation, tensions between administrators and faculty who are responding differently to the current social and economic reshaping of higher education, the perceived reluctance of colleges to adapt to changing expectations and manage costs, and the demands by policymakers and employers that are driven by the changing nature of the workplace, time to degree, and completion rates. Through presentations and group discussions, this session will explore key questions that must be addressed to provide clearer pathways for students who wish to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers and for all students who need to understand how STEM can inform their role as citizens: &nbsp;How can perspectives of educators, students, employers, and policymakers be better aligned to create clarity about what to expect of college graduates? How can learning goals and expectations for workplace success help shape&mdash;at federal, state, and institutional levels&mdash;educational and public policies that address both the preparation of a well-educated citizenry and more STEM professionals?</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6784</td><td>Targeting Tumors: Ion Beam Accelerators Take Aim at Cancer</td><td>Advances in the design and operation of particle accelerators built for basic physics research are leading to the rapid evolution of machines that deliver cancer-killing beams. The trend has been toward less expensive, more versatile particle beam delivery systems, designed for improved efficacy and greater access for cancer patients around the world. Because proton and ion beams deposit most of their energy where the beam stops rather than as they travel through tissue, they can deliver cell-killing energy with extreme precision, allowing lower dosing with less damage to adjacent healthy tissue than conventional X-ray or electron radiation treatments. This symposium explores the scientific rationale behind hadron beam therapy from the perspectives of a physicist who designs state-of-the-art particle accelerators, a radiobiologist exploring how those particle beams affect cells and tumors, and an oncologist. It also addresses the question of relative efficacy of hadron therapy compared to conventional radiation treatment, as well as the challenges of leveraging scientific expertise to bring advances driven by basic research to the benefit of society at large.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6794</td><td>Nurturing Scientific Innovation and Entrepreneurship within the University Ecosystem</td><td>The U.S. is facing significant challenges in bringing innovations based on emerging scientific discoveries into the global market. While the U.S. remains the world leader in scientific and engineering research and education, it can do much more to commercialize its best discoveries and catalyze the creation of ecologically beneficial products and ventures by increasing opportunities for the practical translation of research discoveries into inventions and technology innovations that will improve society and create economic benefits. For university research to achieve greater impact, academic researchers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines need tools, knowledge, and access to networks and resources that support and enable those outcomes. This symposium brings together leaders of programs that engage researchers, students, and faculty in engineering and science in pursuing innovative and entrepreneurial learning and doing. Panelists will discuss the creation of effective educational ecosystems for stimulating and supporting emerging STEM innovators and courses/programs designed to assist academic researchers to evaluate their technology&rsquo;s readiness for translation into practical applications and eventual commercialization. The symposium will discuss the process of developing a healthy innovative and entrepreneurial ecosystem; &ldquo;training the trainers&rdquo;; and guiding students as they bring their inventions and innovations out of the lab and into the hands of the communities those solutions are designed to benefit.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6807</td><td>Transplant Organ Shortage: Informing National Policies Using Management Sciences</td><td>The clinical success of transplantation for the treatment of organ failure has resulted in a severe organ shortage; for example, there are currently almost 100,000 individuals in the U.S. on the waiting list for kidney transplantation.&nbsp;Despite efforts, the total number of deceased and living organ donations remains flat at about 17,000. Consequently, waiting times and wait list mortality is at an all-time high.&nbsp;Organ allocation policies are determined based on legislated priorities, and organs are distributed based on suboptimal algorithms.&nbsp;There is a growing interest in optimizing organ utilization, while preserving the ethical equipoise between equity, justice, and utility. This trans-disciplinary symposium focuses on the use of advanced data-driven and model-based approaches to promote evidence-based policy changes that would make the U.S. organ transplant system more efficient and equitable.&nbsp;After introducing the process of determining national allocation policies, the speakers will focus on the use of scientific approaches to decrease current national inefficiencies and geographic disparities for organs from deceased donors and to inform allocation policy that optimizes utilization.&nbsp;The session will discuss the use of market design science to increase live donor transplantation, including addressing the problem of donor-recipient mismatches, the concept of regulated markets for live donors, and ethical considerations of live donor incentives.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6809</td><td>Securing Fisheries Through Novel Approaches: Opportunities of Genetics and Genomics</td><td>Marine fish are a major natural resource, and fishing&mdash;providing nutrition and income since millennia&mdash;is deeply embedded in human culture. However, in many regions massive fishing activity&mdash;legal and illegal&mdash;has had a dramatic impact, with virtually 70 percent of the world&rsquo;s fish stocks being fully exploited, overexploited, or collapsing. Policymakers and fishery managers worldwide strive to design strategies for sustainable exploitation. These endeavors rely heavily on scientific information, and a number of countries actively seek scientific advice for marine management and conservation. &nbsp;Despite recent progress in fishery genetics, enabled by rapid technology advancement, genetics and genomics are not yet routinely applied for fishery or aquaculture management, with a few notable exceptions. Novel genetic and genomic approaches can readily be applied to address crucial issues, e.g., management and conservation unit identification, revealing adaptive responses to exploitation or environmental changes, identification of farm escapees, improvement of breeding schemes, and support to control. This session presents recent progress in fishery genetics and genomics, introduces innovative analytical approaches, provides examples of approaches that are successfully applied for management or control, and explores how the transfer of genetics and genomics into fishery and aquaculture management could be strengthened.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6816</td><td>Where's My Flying Car? Science, Science Fiction, and a Changing Vision of the Future</td><td>Since the late 19th&nbsp;century, science fiction has captivated the imaginations of readers around the world. Always looking beyond the current state of the art, its authors have envisioned, often with considerable accuracy, the emergence of numerous new technologies and fields of study<b>&mdash;</b>from space travel and communications satellites to genetic engineering and the resurrection of extinct species. In addition to producing sweeping vistas of a utopian future, science fiction has produced numerous cautionary tales and explored ethical dilemmas associated with the use of new technologies before such capabilities were even possible. Along the way, it has inspired countless young minds to choose careers in the sciences, highlighted the importance of scientific literacy, and entertained millions. This symposium gathers prominent science fiction authors and scientists to discuss the constant interplay between this literary genre and the conduct and applications of science, as well how the public&rsquo;s vision of the future has changed over time and what that might tell us about what comes next.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6829</td><td>The Soils of Africa: A Forgotten Resource</td><td>In most people&rsquo;s minds, soil&nbsp;does not rank highly in the list of Africa's&nbsp;natural resources. However, healthy and fertile soils are the cornerstones of food security, key environmental services, social cohesion, and the economies of most African countries. Unfortunately, soil tends only to reach public awareness when it fails&mdash;often with catastrophic consequences, as seen by the famine episodes of the Sahel in the 1980s and more recently in Niger and the Horn of Africa. Regrettably, soil is also taken for granted by most politicians and decision-makers. In reality, Africa has some of the most fertile land on the planet, but in general most of the soils are fragile, often lacking in essential nutrients and organic matter. A population of over 1 billion people and growing, aridity and desertification affecting more than half of land surface, conflicting or competing demands on the use of the land (e.g., cash crops, biofuel, ecological reserves, carbon sequestration, mineral extraction, and urban expansion), and high levels of rural poverty and climate change are providing intense and increasing pressures on the remaining soils.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6830</td><td>Re-Identification Risk of De-Identified Data Sets in the Era of Big Data</td><td>Federal statistical agencies and their contractors often collect data from individuals or other entities under a pledge of confidentiality.&nbsp; Dissemination of these results in the form of public microdata files can facilitate advances in research, inform public policy, and further citizens&rsquo; knowledge. As the demand for access to publicly available microdata files increases, there are growing concerns regarding the confidentiality of the collected information. Federal agencies are ethically and legally obligated to protect the confidentiality of subjects&rsquo; identities and failure to do so can break promises and violate laws. Ideally, publicly available microdata should be released in a way that balances the usefulness of the data and the privacy of the subjects. Numerous statistical methods to assess re-identification risk have been proposed in the literature, and it is important that U.S. federal government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and Veterans Affairs invest in gaining a comprehensive understanding of these methods for the purpose of creating a guidance or checklist of recommended procedures. This session will provide guidance regarding methods that have been used or could be applied to protect health data that is already de-identified according to the Safe Harbor method.&nbsp;Speakers will provide descriptions and information on techniques that have been applied in practice and are interpretable by the general community.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6834</td><td>Epigenetic Control of Brain and Behavior</td><td>Epigenetics is an environmentally-induced persistent alteration in gene expression that has only recently been shown to play a powerful role in brain function. Epigenetic alterations of DNA may be pharmacologically modifiable and also offer novel interventions for brain disorders. This session will provide an overview of epigenetic processes and how they can be monitored in the brain. The role of epigenetic alterations in gene expression and the phenotypic manifestations of autism, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder and Huntington&rsquo;s disease will be reviewed, as well as the implications for novel pharmacologic treatments.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6839</td><td>Intelligent Autonomous Robots: Biologically Inspired Engineering</td><td>Through hundreds of millions of years of evolution by natural selection, animals have become equipped with diverse, powerful, and adaptive means of locomotion and corresponding control systems. Much of the success of these creatures depends on their ability to navigate autonomously, flexibly, and accurately in water, on land, or in the air. Today evolution by engineering is complementing and even extending what nature has accomplished, through the production of biologically inspired, autonomous robots. These devices enable testing what is understood about biomechanics and sensorimotor control systems and promise to serve mankind in previously unimagined ways. This symposium brings together leaders in the field of bio-robotics to present examples of progress in development and testing of robots based on knowledge about the sensorimotor systems of insects, the remarkable ability of weakly electric fish to navigate in murky water, and the amazingly rapid and elegant gait of a running cheetah.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6855</td><td>Understanding the Science Needed for Sustainable Urban Development</td><td>World population is expected to increase to 9 billion people in just three decades. Two out of three people will probably be living in cities by that time. New cities will have to be created and built, and old cities will have to be adapted to considerably larger populations. This calls for a fundamental understanding of the complex structures and interrelated dynamics of cities, in order to address accelerating global challenges such as climate change, lack of energy and other resources, and environmental degradation. Recent studies show that the complexity of cities can be studied as mathematical and scientific analyses. Some features show remarkable likenesses between cities of different sizes, and may be expressed as &ldquo;superlinear&rdquo; equations, showing an exponential growth of social interaction, production, and creativity as cities grow larger. However, these interrelations are often overlooked, leading to less than ideal and sometimes counterproductive plans, policies, and measures. Practical and relevant academic knowledge must be made accessible to practitioners and policymakers through new and open arenas for exchange and capacity building. Research centers and global organizations have a shared responsibility to contribute to better governance for sustainable urban development.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6863</td><td>Risk-Based Standards for Cybersecurity: Global Challenges and Solutions</td><td>A cyber domain integrates and supports critical infrastructures, global economic prosperity, public health and safety, and national security. The U.S., EU and other governments are calling for a strengthened position against cyber attacks. Viruses, Trojan horses, denial of service attacks, and other methods can compromise sensitive data and disrupt critical services. Toward this end, President Obama&rsquo;s Executive Order 13636 calls for adopting and implementing risk-based standards to identify high-risk infrastructure and select alternatives for cyber risk mitigation. What does it mean for a standard to be &ldquo;risk-based&rdquo;?&nbsp; Risk is traditionally defined as a triplet consisting of what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, and the consequences of it happening. However, traditional approaches to risk analysis are insufficient given the rapid pace of evolution and the unprecedented uncertainty inherent in cyber threats. This symposium brings together government officials and technology industry representatives responsible for standard development and scientists studying risk-based standards. The dynamic nature of cyber risks requires semi-quantitative methods that integrate technical data and value judgments. Moreover, continuous assimilation of new information and monitoring of changing stakeholder priorities and adversarial capabilities through adaptive management are required for successful implementation of a cybersecurity framework.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6882</td><td>U.S. National User Facilities: A Major Force for Discovery and Innovation</td><td>The United States&rsquo; national scientific user facilities provide unique capabilities, instrumentation, and expertise annually to approximately 50,000 scientists and engineers from academia, government, and industry.&nbsp;For many of these individuals, a user facility is their laboratory&mdash;their primary platform for experimental research&mdash;and they gain access to these unique tools through peer-reviewed proposals. Much of the research is basic (discovery) research, but the rich interdisciplinary environment promotes interactions among scientists from diverse fields, institutional types, and countries to facilitate the translation of these discovery findings into solutions to real-world problems. This symposium provides an overview of the capabilities offered by these national facilities and highlights outstanding recent examples of discovery and innovation stemming from work at the user facilities, including the development of energy-harvesting &ldquo;solar shingles,&rdquo; the discovery of the structure of key biological molecules, the development of new drugs, and the discovery and the contributions to our understanding of fundamental science. The symposium includes presentations by the major federal sponsors of the user facilities with time for discussion of the policy challenges facing this key facet of the U.S. scientific enterprise now and into the future.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6890</td><td>The Future of Cities: Dense or Dispersed?</td><td>United Nations indicates that almost 200,000 people are urbanizing on this planet every day. This means we, as a global species, need to build a new or expanded city of a million inhabitants every week. The question becomes: Where do these new urban dwellers go in the dense, vertical city or the dispersed, horizontal city? There are many that believe that the sustainability benefits of increased density in cities (e.g., better land use, reduction of suburban infrastructure, reduced vehicle travel time, etc.) are considerable. However there are implications to this&mdash;not least the social implications of people living and working in denser proximity. This panel brings together professionals with varied perspectives&mdash;architects, urban planners, engineers, and social scientists&mdash;to fully present and then debate the issues.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6893</td><td>The Evolving Great Lakes: New Techniques, Discoveries, and Management Implications</td><td>The 10 largest lakes in the world hold 60 percent of our planet&rsquo;s surface fresh water.&nbsp;People are drawn to their shores for ready access to clean water, abundant fish, inexpensive transportation, and an appealing lifestyle.&nbsp;Many of the world&rsquo;s great lakes share a common threat of dropping lake level: in January 2013, Lake Michigan was at its lowest stand in recorded history, while the levels of many of the East African Rift Valley lakes will soon be threatened by expanding irrigation in their catchments. At the same time, the North American and African Great Lakes are experiencing contrasting changes in biodiversity, which is increasing in the Laurentian Great Lakes due to invasive species and decreasing in the African Rift lakes due to over fishing and habitat degradation.&nbsp;In this session we explore the evolution of some great lakes ecosystems on different time scales, beginning with the latest results from the Lake Malawi (East Africa) Drilling Project, a remarkable history of cichlid fish evolution in the African tropics, and the dramatic shift in ecosystem structure of Lake Michigan and the other Laurentian Great Lakes that resulted from the introduction of exotic species.&nbsp;Our means of detecting ecosystem change in the world&rsquo;s great lakes continue to improve, and some of the new approaches will be described. The session will include a discussion among the speakers and audience regarding implications for future management of these invaluable aquatic resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6899</td><td>Extremities of the Cosmos: New Experimental Results in Particle Astrophysics</td><td>Particle astrophysics probes the most extreme environments of nature: the highest energies, the emptiest vacuum of space, the smallest times and distances, the earliest moments of time, and new forms of matter and energy that dominate the origin and evolution of the cosmos as a whole. This symposium features speakers in several areas where new experimental techniques are currently producing new results with rapid improvements in precision and/or sensitivity. Leading scientists will present results from their own projects while also providing a short survey of related results worldwide in this fast-moving field. An overview of particle astrophysics&mdash;experiments that probe new fundamental physics by using the extreme environments provided by the cosmos&mdash;and &nbsp;new experimental results will be discussed, including data on showers created by the highest energy cosmic rays that give clues to their origin and composition;&nbsp;deep underground experiments that limit, or in some cases hint at detections of, interactions with weakly interacting cosmic dark matter particles from the halo of our galaxy; gamma ray telescopes that give a new view into the highest energy cataclysms of the cosmos, and possibly intragalactic dark matter decays and annihilations; and a new kind of experiment being developed to probe evidence of quantum behavior of space-time itself, and a minimum interval of time.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6906</td><td>New North-South Funding for Fighting Poverty-Related Diseases</td><td>The symposium proposes a new global partnership between funders of health research to promote international cooperation on poverty-related diseases between researchers from the &ldquo;South&rdquo; and those from the &ldquo;North.&rdquo; Poverty-related diseases affect the world&rsquo;s poorest and most marginalized communities. They undermine productivity and increase insecurity and infirmity, thus perpetuating the cycle of poverty. While general improvements of nutrition, sanitation, and health infrastructures will be important, an effective long-term control will also require the development of improved medical interventions. However, there is a general lack of both public and private investments. The formation of international and cross-sectorial partnerships between research performers and funders, from both the public and private sector, has proven to be a viable and effective way for accelerating the development of improved medical interventions. Pioneering international partnerships, such as the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, succeeded in bridging the strategic, financial, and cultural boundaries and generating results which would not have been achieved by single countries and single sectors acting alone. The symposium focuses on innovative ideas in bringing on new partners, increasing engagement of public funders, and leveraging private funding from different sectors. The panel will present and discuss new financing and partnership mechanisms.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6907</td><td>Building Babies: Development, Evolution, and Human Health</td><td>How do we, as individuals, become who we are? How our bodies function, our minds perceive the world, and we behaviorally respond to the challenges we face are shaped by early life experiences. Recent research by evolutionary anthropologists, biopsychologists, nutritionists, and behavioral neuroscientists has demonstrated that a developmental, evolutionary perspective substantially informs our understanding of the phenomena of individual differences. This symposium discusses mechanisms and pathways through which early life environment exert profound influences on humans and non-human primates and considers the potential functions of this developmental plasticity regulating life-history trade-offs. In this symposium, speakers will juxtapose the behavioral care of mothers, fathers, and wider social networks with physiological investment of the placenta and mother&rsquo;s milk. Moreover, epigenetic modification can result from the interaction between the infant&rsquo;s genome and the behavioral and physiological environments of early life and previous generations. This symposium will provide exposure to a wide range of methodological and theoretical approaches to developmental trajectories and model how researchers might productively integrate these different perspectives into their own work.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6917</td><td>Synthetic Biology Approaches to New Chemistry</td><td>The ability to manipulate the chemistry of small molecules and macromolecules has long been a focus of modern chemical research. Post-genomic advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis have revolutionized our ability to re-encode genetic function and begin designing living cells and organisms using synthetic biology approaches. Living systems have evolved streamlined solutions to many challenges that face chemists today, such as the ability to carry out multi-step chemical syntheses from renewable resources, to sense target analytes with high selectivity and sensitivity, and to construct advanced materials&nbsp;from earth-abundant elements. Thus, synthetic biology offers new opportunities for innovation in chemistry by tapping into these functions and providing an inexpensive and sustainable path for chemical production and device engineering. This symposium explores recent advances in the design of parts and devices used for construction of new chemical functions in cells, as well as either application to the production of pharmaceuticals, fuels, and materials.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6918</td><td>Genetic and Epigenetic Determinants of Susceptibility to Toxicants</td><td>The most common chronic disorders are multifactorial in nature, influenced by complex sequences of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. While gene expression is a dynamic process that varies in response to a myriad of internal and external triggers and the surrounding micro-environment, epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in mediating environmental influences on gene expression and epistatic interactions. In this respect, the expression of complex phenotypes should be assessed in a functional context that examines the interplay between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in genetic and epigenetic research offer new opportunities to integrate experimental approaches, including animal models and <em>in vitro</em>/<em>in vivo</em> translational research, with computational strategies to predict such interactions at multiple levels of complexity. This session focuses on current research investigating the role of genetic factors, epigenetic factors, and gene-environment interactions in the development and outcomes of complex diseases caused by environmental and occupational toxicants.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6922</td><td>Will the Workplace of Tomorrow Have Any Workers? Computing, Productivity, and Jobs</td><td>Public anxiety about the adverse effects of technological change on employment and earnings dates back at least as far as the Industrial Revolution when, in the early 19th century, a group of English textile artisans calling themselves the Luddites staged a &ldquo;machine trashing&rdquo; rebellion, destroying the automated looms that would, they feared, reduce the demand for their skills. Economists have consistently derided these concerns, arguing that those who fear technological unemployment are succumbing to a &ldquo;lump of labor&rdquo; fallacy. In the last decade, this consensus has begun to erode, with some prominent economists opining that this time is different&mdash;specifically, that the rapid advance of information technology, computer perception, and robotics implies that humans are on the verge of being eclipsed by machinery in many employment spheres. In this symposium, prominent economists with divergent perspectives informed by history, data, and theory will critically evaluate this evolving debate to consider both the aggregate benefits and potential social costs of rapid technological progress, and to explore the set of public investment and social insurance policies that can best prepare countries to maximize gains and minimize adverse impacts from recent and incipient technological advances.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6923</td><td>Responsible Innovation in a Global Context</td><td>Responsible research and innovation is an emerging term of art in science and innovation policy across the globe. In one definition, it is &ldquo;a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability, and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products.&rdquo; In another, it is &ldquo;a commitment of care for the future through collective stewardship of science and innovation in the present.&rdquo; It has been enshrined in recent research calls at the European level, and its cognate &ldquo;responsible development&rdquo; has been part of the strategic vision of the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative for a decade. Yet, despite a spate of attention, there is neither a clear, unified vision of what responsible innovation is, nor what it requires, nor what it can accomplish. Regardless of specific definition, responsible innovation is about enhancing the connections between the considered values of the wider community and the processes of policy decisions and science and technology development. This panel brings together a number of participants in an emerging Virtual Institute for Responsible Innovation to discuss recent research on responsible innovation as an object of study, and recent experiments with responsible innovation in policy and academic environments.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6928</td><td>The Science of Resilient Aging</td><td>Contrary to popular beliefs about inevitable deterioration with age, there is accumulating evidence for wide variation in patterns of growth and decline through the adult lifespan. In fact, many adults exhibit high levels of physical and mental fitness, engage in satisfying activities, and sustain rich and nurturing social relationships into very late in the life span. Longer life spans are contributing to aging on a global scale. Population aging is unprecedented, pervasive, and projected to endure such that by 2050, for the first time in history, the proportion of adults over the age of 60 is expected to match the number of people who are younger than 15 years of age (with 21percent for each segment of the population). These trends create challenges for virtually every facet of human life, including health, families, work, and civic engagement. It is critical to discover the scientific principles underlying resilient aging and ways to translate these principles so that successful aging becomes the typical, rather than the exceptional, case. This interdisciplinary symposium considers a broad array of factors that promote resilient aging, within each domain addressing: What is known about the pathways to aging well? What are the critical outcomes that provide evidence for resilience? &nbsp;Where is the untapped potential for translational intervention, and at what point in the lifespan?</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6931</td><td>Reconstructing and Deconstructing Paintings: Innovations At and Below the Surface</td><td>A deep connection to our past and shared cultural heritage must be preserved to foster a balanced society where all humanity can thrive. Moderated by a museum leader, this symposium presents cross-disciplinary and international perspectives on the scientific study of paintings from all ages. It will describe analysis of paint materials used by Pablo Picasso at the nanoscale, as only possible at the brightest synchrotron sources. It will highlight how new imaging techniques can reveal the invisible, bringing to light underlying compositions of old masters&rsquo; paintings. This in turn enables the writing of new art history and provides important material clues that can assist with attribution and authentication. This symposium will also demonstrate how scientific analysis and cutting-edge computer science can lead to innovative approaches to touchless virtual restoration and to the inspiring public presentation of a contemporary art masterpiece by Mark Rothko, literally turning back the hand of time. Researchers from museums, academia, and large facilities will explain how the use of new technology can lead to new discoveries, which, in turn, can change the public&rsquo;s and the specialists&rsquo; perception of great works of art.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6933</td><td>The Importance of Recreational Mathematics in Solving Practical Problems</td><td>Mathematical and scientific research inspired by games and puzzles has proved surprisingly resilient in finding practical applications.&nbsp;For example, the development of probability theory resulted from the earnest contemplation of problems faced by gamblers.&nbsp;In the 20th century, much progress in computer science resulted from trying to program a machine to play chess.&nbsp;Far from being a mere historical artifact, the relationship between pure mathematics and practical considerations is as strong today as it ever has been.&nbsp;The symposium brings together experts whose research has bridged the gap between recreational and practical mathematics, with particular emphasis on recent work in computer science and economics.&nbsp;The multidisciplinary nature of this research, typical of modern mathematics, will also be featured prominently.&nbsp;The discoveries and innovations that will solve global problems will not necessarily come from direct approaches to those problems, and the freedom of researchers to explore seemingly impractical problems is essential.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6935</td><td>Air Quality and Climate Change: Science and Policy Challenges</td><td>Significant recent attention has been given to the air pollution and climate change interface. Specifically, there is a growing body of scientific understanding accompanied by a political realization that many of the pollutants currently under the air quality umbrella could be targeted for quick action to achieve near-term climate goals. There are, however, a number of complexities in addressing air quality and climate change in an integrated way, in addition to the difficulty of comparing long-lived greenhouse gases with short-lived pollutants. Thorough scientific evaluation of trade-offs and co-benefits of such policies and the economic and political implications of such integration at the various levels of governance are needed prior to large-scale action. The recent establishment of the high-profile Climate and Clean Air Coalition has sought to bring this discussion out of the academic sphere and into the political arena. However, if too much emphasis is put on quick wins for climate, air quality could be neglected, or actions detrimental to air quality could be taken. This symposium will present an overview of the current state-of-the-science with respect to climate forcing air pollutants. Policy perspectives will discuss some of the challenges, as well as some of the benefits and possible pitfalls of such an integrated approach at the national and international level.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6938</td><td>Inside Out: The Impact of Gut Flora on Diabetes and Obesity</td><td>In recent years, the 1.5 kilos of bacteria that live inside our bodies, mainly in the gut, have proven to be crucially important to our healthy functioning. Beyond their more obvious role in digestion, they are also involved, for example, in the development of the immune system and the neuronal system and in the onset of certain diseases. Three &ldquo;enterotypes,&rdquo; or gut types, have been identified that characterize a balanced, yet different relationship between the human host and its personal bacteria. Imbalances of that gut flora have been linked to major health challenges such as diabetes and obesity. Several research teams are now leading cutting-edge projects to further scientific understanding of these relations and, on the longer term, design innovative and tailor-made dietary products, treatments, and prevention tools.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6945</td><td>Comparative Advantage: Global Perspectives on Human Biology and Health</td><td>Human physiological systems are products of natural selection, evolved to develop and function in whole organisms that are integral components of surrounding social and physical environments. Developmental plasticity and ecological sensitivity are defining characteristics of human biology, and, as a result, global environmental variation produces substantial variation in human biology around the world. Yet the vast majority of research on human biology is conducted in controlled clinical settings in affluent industrialized countries, and cannot capture the full range of socio-ecological environments that may be important for gaining insights into the development, function, and evolution of critical physiological systems. A field-based, comparative approach to research on human biology in diverse communities around the world has the potential to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of human biological variation, and to complement&mdash;and at times challenge&mdash;prevailing clinic- and lab-based research paradigms.&nbsp;This symposium features recent research in biological anthropology that highlights the value of a comparative human biology approach.&nbsp;Presentations will draw on data collected from field sites in North and South America, Asia, the South Pacific, and Africa to generate insights into human immune function, reproductive aging, nutrition and metabolism, and chronic disease.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6948</td><td>New Insights into Animal Behavior: The Role of the Microbiome</td><td>How and why animals behave the way they do has fascinated humans for centuries. Many insights into the causes and consequences of animal behavior have been gleaned by considering how an animal&rsquo;s genotype and physical or social (e.g., competitors, mates, predators) environment influence behavior. Now, new studies are revealing that the trillions of microbes in and on most animals&rsquo; bodies also play a fundamental role in determining behavior. Microbes in the gut can influence levels of anxiety and depression in mice; blood-feeding mosquitoes select victims based on the microbial composition of human skin; and even the mating preferences of fruit flies are strongly shaped by microbes. Studies spanning laboratory animal models and natural field systems are essential for uncovering the nature and implications of these host-microbe interactions. This session explores how research across a diversity of settings is elucidating the mechanisms by which microbes alter behavior and <i>vice versa</i>, and the broader consequences of these effects. The session also highlights how understanding connections between microbes and animal behavior may translate into novel approaches for treating behavioral disorders in humans.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6960</td><td>Technological Innovations and Their Impact on Astronomical Discovery</td><td>Discovery based on innovation has been the hallmark of astronomy over the past two decades. Our understanding of the universe&mdash;from our own solar system to the broad issues of cosmology&mdash;has improved immeasurably over this period while, paradoxically, what we don&rsquo;t know related to such issues as dark matter and energy has also been highlighted. This session covers technological innovations and their impact on astronomical research and discovery. The focus of each talk centers on a particular technological innovation that has transformed the field of astronomy in some way:&nbsp;large telescopes, adaptive optics, infrared arrays, wide field imaging surveys, radio interferometry, and instruments for cosmic microwave background measurements.&nbsp;The session describes the technology, the history of its development, and the astronomical discoveries and research enabled by the technology.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6975</td><td>Santa's Revenge: The Impacts of Arctic Warming on the Mid-Latitudes</td><td>Increasingly disruptive weather at northern hemisphere mid-latitudes is causing dramatic property and agricultural damage, human health issues and suffering, and associated high costs. These weather events have included hurricanes, tornados, extreme temperatures, persistent regional droughts, and the warmest year yet recorded in the contiguous 48 states of the U.S. Concurrently with these disruptive weather events, the Arctic region continues to warm and lose ice and snow cover. Among other effects, this loss increases high latitude absorption of incoming solar radiation, which in turn increases temperatures, contributes to further ice and snow melting, and increases release of carbon dioxide and methane from formerly frozen permafrost. This transition from a white to a blue Arctic is reflected in high latitude warming two to three times greater than the global average. Although geographically remote, these high-latitude changes are causally linked to mid-latitude weather. Likely impacts include, for example, threats to freshwater availability in the U.S., Russia, and elsewhere, which in turn impacts industry and agriculture, one effect being grain price increases that contribute to instabilities in the Middle East. This symposium examines these complex phenomena and their effects on freshwater resources, food availability, and national security.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6978</td><td>How Does Oral Health Fit in the Emerging Health Care Environment?</td><td><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"></span>
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">As the United States becomes a more racially and ethnically diverse nation, our caregivers and healthcare systems will need to be prepared to accommodate the varied perceptions and expectations for health and well-being. The consequences of these diverse perspectives have been heightened with the initiation of the Affordable Health Care Act. Underlying the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s determination to expand meaningful health coverage to uninsured Americans, while also assuring meaningful employer-sponsored health coverage, are a set of themes intended to reform U.S. healthcare. Taken together these themes seek to fulfill the goal of better health outcomes at lower cost with improved patient and population experience. Decades of research have confirmed that maintaining good oral health is an important component of one&rsquo;s overall health and well-being. However, it is not clear how oral health policy fits into the emerging health care environment. In question is how dentistry, as a profession and a delivery system, will engage, or be engaged, in this evolution: Will dentistry remain on the sidelines, be sidelined by others, or integrate its services within the envisioned new healthcare environment? The session will take on these questions and lead a discussion on insurance issues, health disparities, and new workforce models.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';"><br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6986</td><td>Nanoelectronics for Renewable Energy: How Nanoscale Innovations Address Global Needs</td><td>Sometimes it's possible to get a handle on the world's biggest problems by thinking creatively on a very small scale&mdash;and advances in the rapidly maturing field of nanoelectronics prove it. Innovations that hold promise for broader and faster adoption of renewable energy technologies loom large against a backdrop of population growth, rapid industrialization in developing countries, and initiatives to decrease reliance on both fossil fuels and nuclear power. In this symposium, researchers from the U.S. and Europe will review the latest progress in nanoelectronics for renewable energy across a series of interrelated programs. For instance, new manufacturing approaches such as nanoimprinting, nanotransfer, and spray-on fabrication of organic semiconductors not only point the way toward low-cost production of large-scale electronics such as solar panels, they also enable and inspire novel nanoelectronic device designs. These device-level innovations range from ultrasensitive molecular sensors to nanomagnet logic circuits, and they are of particular interest in solar energy applications. Many lines of research appear to be converging on nanostructure-based solar cells that will be vastly more efficient in capturing sunlight (or even heat) and converting it to electrical power. In addition to outlining these promising paths toward higher-efficiency, lower-cost photovoltaics, the symposium will highlight some of the remaining hurdles, including needed advances in fundamental science.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6987</td><td>The Central Role of Energy Concepts in K-12 Science Education</td><td>Energy plays a central role in all science disciplines as well as our everyday lives. As a consequence, students&rsquo; understanding of the concept of energy receives particular consideration in policy documents, including educational standards around the world. Energy is one of several &ldquo;big ideas&rdquo; of science that are also referred to as &ldquo;crosscutting concepts&rdquo; or &ldquo;enduring understandings&rdquo; and are found in every year of schooling and across disciplines. Energy is also a disciplinary core idea, and the distinction between energy in this context and energy as a crosscutting concept is not always apparent. Science education researchers have studied students&rsquo; understanding of energy and proposed means to support the development of their understanding. However, until now, no consistent way of teaching the energy concept exists that will foster the development of a comprehensive understanding throughout K-12; an empirically validated K-12 learning progression of energy is missing. As the K-12 curriculum changes to accommodate research on how students understand energy, parallel changes at universities can promote coherence across science disciplines and college student realization of the interdisciplinary nature of the energy concept.&nbsp;This session features an in-depth look and one-hour interactive discussion with attendees on K-12 research on energy concepts, its implications, and how it can impact college instruction.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>6990</td><td>Video Games, Brains, and Society</td><td>Computer and video games have emerged as one of the most powerful media of the 21st century, generating billions of hours of highly engaging entertainment. A growing body of research is also highlighting the enormous potential of games and game-infused experiences to help address some of the most pressing social, cultural, scientific, and economic challenges of the 21st century. To take advantage of this power to captivate, we need to create therapeutic and educational video games that are as much fun and as appealing as the most popular commercial games. As President Obama told a college audience, &ldquo;I want you guys to be stuck on a video game that&rsquo;s teaching you something other than just blowing something up.&rdquo; Unfortunately, a significant gap remains between the growing body of research highlighting the potential for game-based learning and the transformation of these findings into scalable products and services. This symposium discusses how to understand and bridge this gap.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7006</td><td>Virtual Humans: Helping Facilitate Breakthroughs in Medicine</td><td>Advances in computer hardware and software has made it possible to model the human system <i>in silico</i>, conduct virtual experiments, and validate these with in vitro/in vivo experiments. In addition to developing realistic simulations of the human, a new emerging field&mdash;systems medicine&mdash;is facilitating the integration of various &ldquo;omics&rdquo; along with detailed engineering and mathematical models of the human system. This, in turn, has allowed significant improvements in medical diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp;In this symposium, experts in computer graphics, engineering, and medicine discuss current state-of-the-art and future directions in computer-based modeling of humans at various levels of abstraction and how computational models and simulations are aiding new discoveries in medicine. Key topics covered are P4 Medicine (Personalized, Predictive, Preventive, Participatory), drug validations through a virtual liver, cardiovascular simulation models, advancing education through virtual human anatomy and physiology, neural disorders modeling and simulation, and physics-based models of hip injury.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7008</td><td>Next Generation Electrical Energy Storage: Beyond Lithium Ion Batteries</td><td>The two largest energy sectors&mdash;electricity and transportation&mdash;are poised for transformational change driven by next generation electrical energy storage.&nbsp;The future electricity grid will deploy wind and solar generation on a wide scale, level load peaks and valleys, and manage demand using high capacity, low cost&nbsp;stationary energy storage embedded in a smart grid. Personal transportation ready for electrification will replace foreign oil with domestic electricity and significantly reduce carbon emissions, driven by portable high energy density, low cost electricity storage. These transformational impacts on transportation and the grid require next generation electrical energy storage with five times the energy density and one-fifth the cost of today&rsquo;s best commercial batteries. The symposium examines the impact that such electricity storage technologies will have on the grid and transportation, and the promising discoveries and innovations beyond today&rsquo;s lithium ion battery technology that will raise performance and lower cost.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7009</td><td>How to Rebuild Informed Trust in Science: Insights from Social Sciences</td><td>Many decisions in one&rsquo;s personal, public, or professional spheres are based on scientific information, and advances in information technologies make access to information easy. However, ease of access forces non-experts to make informed choices about which source to trust. Non-experts can understand only at a broad level why a certain science-based knowledge claim might be true. Hence, the public has to rely on a (preferably informed) trust in science-based information and in the sources of such information. Developing informed trust is challenging because difficulties in understanding scientific information come along with the experience that establishing scientific evidence is a continuous and ongoing process, and that thereby many results as well as theories are discussed as tentative truth within the discourse of science. Even those scientific findings where a majority of scientists agree (e.g., climate change) are continuously subject to debate and all findings are, in principle, revisable. However, in the face of needing concrete answers and immediate problem solving, the evolving nature of science knowledge may lead the public to question and discount the general veracity of science information. Researchers from communication science as well as from psychology and learning sciences will discuss detrimental as well as enhancing conditions for the evolution of informed trust in science in light of fragile and conflicting scientific evidence.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7010</td><td>Science Policy-Making that Meets Social Challenges and Motivates Scientists</td><td>Facing current global economic conditions, the science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy of many countries increasingly focuses on the contribution of research and development (R&amp;D) outcomes to address various societal issues. A central consideration is how to link scientific research to innovation and economic growth, and some issue-driven R&amp;D strategies are already being examined. This new emphasis highlights some major problems that do not arise with traditional discipline-driven R&amp;D, e.g., immaturity in the methodology used to identify societal issues, to make national STI policies, and to develop R&amp;D strategy through a rational and objective process. Moreover, there is a concern about the autonomy of scientific research. If R&amp;D themes are identified and transferred to researchers as a top-down policy by decision-makers, the motivation for research might be diminished. The importance of scientists&rsquo; normative conduct also needs to be considered, especially for those who work on complex and uncertain issues that might involve political decision-making. This session presents an overview of the status of issue-driven R&amp;D strategy and shares experiences in policy formation. The discussion will include aspects such as possible measures to foster scientists&rsquo; sense of commitment in meeting social challenges, how to provide promising career paths for able young scientists, and ways to integrate bottom-up research themes raised by researchers themselves.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7017</td><td>Innovation and Collaboration at 17,500 MPH: The&nbsp;International Space Station Experience</td><td>The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique, multidisciplinary laboratory where the scientific endeavors of 68 countries have found their footholds in space research for the betterment of human exploration and the betterment of life on Earth.&nbsp;This symposium brings together expert investigators from varied research fields currently studied onboard the ISS who are engaged in investigations requiring international coordination and collaboration.&nbsp;The panelists will share with the community their experiences in leading these investigations, working with international teams, and some of the exciting new results from their research programs.&nbsp;A one-hour moderated discussion with ISS program scientists will be provided after the panelists complete their presentations</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7019</td><td>Biosciences for Farming in Africa</td><td>African economies are now among the fastest growing in the world. By some estimates Africa's population may double to 2.3 billion people over the next 40 years with the transition from a rural to a predominantly urban society. Yet Africa still has 15 of the least developed nations in the world, many hundreds of millions of people remain hungry and in poverty, and food security and sustainability, health, and the possible effects of climate change are major issues. Importantly, agriculture currently employs close to 70 percent of the population with women playing the principal role, and nearly 60 percent of the world&rsquo;s available arable land is in Africa. Food production must increase if it is to feed those hungry now and the rapidly growing population. While there is no single solution, recent advances in the biosciences and new genetic technologies can contribute. New traits can be rapidly incorporated, existing crops tailored to meet new requirements, and time and costs greatly reduced. Local crops can be made higher yielding, resistant to pests and drought, and more nutritious, and provide income to small-scale farmers. The symposium discusses the role of new technologies in economic transformation, examples of new genetics research on local crops, and work to ensure human and environmental biosafety, public communication, and preparation of the young as future farmers. Scientific and government policy viewpoints will be represented.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7020</td><td>Opportunities and Challenges for Nuclear Small Modular Reactors</td><td>Can the global use of nuclear energy be expanded enough to make a significant contribution to mitigating climate change while simultaneously reducing the risks of proliferation, terrorist access, nuclear accidents, and nuclear war? Expanding nuclear capacity worldwide based on large centralized facilities (e.g., generating capacity greater than 1 gigawatt) poses challenges and risks due to the large capital outlays, potential safety issues, negative public opinion, and persistent concerns about proliferation&ndash;that is, the intentional misuse of nuclear technology and material. Small modular reactors (SMRs), defined as units with a generating capacity of less than 300 megawatts that are delivered to the site fully assembled, may represent a viable alternative to large reactors since they require smaller initial capitalization, better match existing demand for energy and capacity requirements, may be easier to site, and may engender less public opposition. This symposium evaluates the opportunities and challenges associated with SMRs. It will address the technical challenges for SMR designs, the creation of market incentives that can promote innovation and diffusion of SMRs, and the national and international policy and regulatory environments to ensure safety and proliferation resistance.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7024</td><td>Competing Universities Collaborate on Standard Metrics for Global Benchmarking</td><td>All researchers aspire to achieve international acclaim, and to make a difference, through innovation and excellent research. Institutions drive success through the performance of these individuals, expressed by measures such as citations and award volume, and also demonstrate financial return on investment, such as by licensing income, spin-off activity, and societal impact. No research can be assessed in isolation, but only within the global context.&nbsp;This session explores a collaboration of eight highly successful research universities to agree upon a manageable set of metrics (Snowball Metrics) that capture the strategic aspects of research performance and that are based on consistent data. Speakers will explore how this bottom-up approach has led to comparative metrics that support benchmarking against peers. This interactive session will address the following challenges from the viewpoints of several stakeholders: Can competing universities collaborate to build a standard framework underpinning their strategic decision-making? Does a bottom-up approach to reaching consensus in data and metrics standards achieve traction more effectively than a top-down approach? How should universities build on other work to define standards, such as CASRAI data vocabularies and CERIF data format? How can Snowball Metrics fulfill the demands of others, including sponsors and&nbsp;policymakers, to demonstrate the value of research?</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7027</td><td>Discovering Long-Term Climate Vulnerabilities at the Nature-Society Interface</td><td>Few global challenges loom larger than the social and environmental consequences of climate change. Particularly in semi-arid regions, increasing temperatures and attendant changes in drought severity and drought persistence threaten the sustainability of human communities, agricultural systems, and fire-prone forests. &nbsp;Although these may appear to be exclusively contemporary problems, human communities have lived in semi-arid environments for millennia through variable climates, including droughts more severe and longer in duration than yet experienced as a result of global warming. The interplay between climate, societies, and their environments is not simple and deterministic, however. The complex relationships between social and ecological systems contain feedbacks that can amplify or suppress the impacts of climate extremes. Pioneering interdisciplinary research by archaeologists, dendrochronologists, and complex systems modelers working in the semi-arid Southwestern U.S. has begun to document these dynamic relationships over millennial timescales and across climate transitions. Food and water security, changing fire risk, deforestation, and ecosystem conversion are climate concerns of the past and the present. This symposium highlights the contributions of interdisciplinary investigations of multi-century nature-society couplings for addressing contemporary vulnerabilities to climate change and its social and ecological consequences.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7028</td><td>Agrobiodiversity and Global Change: New Linkages to Sustainability</td><td>Agrobodiversity&mdash;biotic diversity and functioning of agroecosystems&mdash;is receiving increased scientific analysis as a global socioenvironmental change issue. Global perspectives on agrobiodiversity create crucial insights for sustainability and resource management. In so doing agrobiodiversity analysis has matured to a second generation of highly interdisciplinary scientific knowledge. It has transformed assumptions and is now rich with new knowledge and innovative frameworks. These include technological advances in Geographic Information Science (GIS) and genomics. This symposium provides a synthesis of new agrobiodiversity advances and analysis of policy and management for sustainability and sustainable development. It will integrate the disciplinary and interdisciplinary domains of geography, GIScience, land-change science, plant science, genomics, resource and ecological economics, development, nutrition, food security, anthropology, and human health. This scope of interdisciplinarity is integral to needed advances of agrobiodiversity science. Global perspectives are also integral to this synthesis. Speakers will address new knowledge of agrobiodiversity as combined social-ecological values. Focus will be directed at new agrobiodiversity policy opportunities and management issues that utilize both ecological principles and social frameworks of global sustainable development and inclusive wealth that prioritize social and intergenerational equity.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7033</td><td>From Dust and Gas to Disks and Planets</td><td>Radio-wavelength emission is little affected by intervening dust and gas, and astronomical radio telescope systems can probe deep into regions that are largely inaccessible at optical and infrared wavelengths, such as the interiors of the protoplanetary disks where planets are being born. This symposium explores how a new generation of enormously more capable radio-wavelength research tools-such as the international Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico-are revolutionizing our ability to observe, analyze, and understand protoplanetary disk and planet formation, opening new scientific frontiers. The discovery space that astronomers can now explore has recently and dramatically expanded as these state-of-the-art telescope systems have initiated science operations. Astronomers now have access to orders of magnitude better sensitivity, broader wavelength coverage, and increased imaging and spectral resolution that are enabling major advances in our understanding of the kinematics, chemistry, composition, structure, and evolution of the earliest dust-enshrouded phases of protoplanetary disk and planet formation.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7037</td><td>Neoracism and Scientific Racism in &ldquo;Post-Racial&rdquo; Societies</td><td>Discrimination on the basis of race, color, gender, religion, or national origin was outlawed in many countries in the latter half of the 20th century. Despite this, differential treatment of people by race and color has persisted, and new forms of racism&mdash;here termed neoracism&mdash;are being invented. Most forms of neoracism are covert, and are based on assumptions that groups of people called races actually exist and that they differ systematically in aspects of biology, behavior, and/or culture. In this symposium, speakers examine some of the causes and manifestations of neoracism, including the rise of new biomedical and genomic constructs of race, the growth of colorism in communities of color, the historical development of racist ideologies and their rhetoric, and the effects of race labeling and racial iconography on attitudes and performance. Presenters will demonstrate that the persistence of deep-seated beliefs in biogenetic determinism has wide-ranging detrimental effects, including low levels of interest and belief in evolution and the pursuit of education and careers in science. The lived experience of racism and neoracism will be discussed with respect to its effects on human social well-being and health, and on the future of science.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7041</td><td>Stars in the Laboratory: Fundamental Nuclear Physics at the National Ignition Facility</td><td>Nuclear physics is the study of the fundamental building blocks of matter and how they interact and combine to form the nucleons, elements, and exotic nuclear states that constitute the observed universe. The field addresses the origin of the elements formed by nuclear processes in environments from the third minute of the Big Bang to quiescent and explosive stellar systems that have evolved in the later phases of our expanding universe. Nuclear physics has triggered many applications with enormous societal implications, from nuclear energy production to the use of nuclear isotopes for medical diagnostics. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) offers a significant next step in experimental nuclear physics. NIF experiments will be able to probe nuclear reactions in a plasma environment similar to that found in stellar interiors. Such plasma conditions, which allow for significant population of nuclear excited states, cannot be replicated in existing accelerator or reactor based research environments. Probing nuclear interactions in a plasma environment will provide unprecedented opportunities for exploration of phenomena at the intersection of atomic and nuclear physics. The symposium discusses experiments at NIF and other facilities&nbsp;involving nuclear reactions in high-energy-density plasmas.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7042</td><td>Using Social Science to Change Decisions and Improve Health Outcomes</td><td>People make many decisions that affect their health. Some of these decisions serve them well; other decisions lead to tragic outcomes such as heart attacks and strokes. Despite the existence of information that can help people make better decisions, unfortunate outcomes occur. Health practitioners, government agencies, and other concerned citizens continue to raise important questions about why people ignore information that could improve the quality of their lives. A growing number of social scientists are working to improve health decision-making and related outcomes by conducting rigorous and innovative evaluations of what people know about their health and when they are willing to learn more about it. This research offers new insights on the comparative effectiveness of various existing and new ways to communicate health-related information. It also shows how and when distinct approaches are needed to change the behaviors of particular audiences. This symposium includes insights from the social sciences that demonstrate how to present information in ways that change health-related decisions and improve health-related outcomes.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7045</td><td>Making Products Sustainable as Materials Become Scarce</td><td>In 1798 Thomas R. Malthus wrote: "The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man." In 1972 Club of Rome published the report <i>Limits to Growth</i>, which for the first time predicted that economic growth could not continue indefinitely because of the limited availability of natural resources. Today, we are indeed facing unsustainable pressure on resources and on the environment, and the global economy needs a drastic transition from simple linear consumerism to a more resource efficient system. This symposium describes the challenges of today's situation with increasing materials demand for finite amounts of all elements available on Earth. In particular, it will address the situation for raw materials that are critical to high-tech industries. The symposium will show how science and technology can provide innovative solutions for improved eco-efficient use of resources all along the value chain, from tapping into new, unconventional sources to the reduced use or even complete elimination of critical materials, leading ultimately to their high-tech recycling. Product design and moving from a resource-based to knowledge-based industrial economy will be explored.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7049</td><td>Intelligent Context-Aware Systems for Healthcare, Wellness, and Assisted Living</td><td>Context awareness has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with information technology. Whereas conventional computers merely interpret explicit user input, context aware systems analyze and automatically respond to users' behavior and the current situation. This enables electronic systems to assist users in situations in which the use of conventional computers and mobile devices is out of question. This is of particular relevance in the field of healthcare, wellness, and assisted living (HWA) applications. Research on context awareness has continued to intensify in the last decade due to the availability of cheap sensing technologies and mobile systems. Still, building reliable context aware systems that can deal with complex real-life situations and environments remains an open research challenge and requires a multidisciplinary effort. An international consortium of 24 universities, companies, and research organizations have formed to provide a decisive contribution toward solutions, leveraged through an interdisciplinary perspective ranging from sensing and sensor integration to human computer interaction and social factors involved in the deployment of context aware applications and, in doing so, train the next generation of researchers in the field. The symposium illustrates the advances made in the field of context awareness by this large consortium and the benefits for HWA applications in particular.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7052</td><td>Making the Best Use of Academic Knowledge in Innovation Systems</td><td>One of the roles of academic research activities in universities and public research institutes is to conduct basic research that private enterprises cannot. As the outcomes of basic research usually lead to a wide range of application, they would contribute to innovation in corporations to implement economic and social impacts if properly managed. Then, in the current system, are we making the best use of academic knowledge for innovation? Using quantitative data, the symposium addresses to what extent the outcomes of basic research are used for innovation in corporations, whether the current system in each region is valid for linking academic knowledge with innovation, and how we can maximize the impacts of public funding of scientific research on industrial innovation.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7056</td><td>Hazards: What Do We Build For?</td><td>Scientists are changing the way they assess and plan for natural hazards. Many experts are now arguing for an approach that identifies the best practical solutions to cope with hazards, in preference to what they see as a quest for increasingly accurate predictions and an unrealistic emphasis on eradicating uncertainty. The chaotic nature of seismic activity makes it impossible to predict an earthquake with sufficient time for people to leave their homes, for example. Instead, experts are moving toward long-term earthquake forecasts to assess whether buildings should be strengthened. Systems experts look at the likelihood of hazards and the balance the costs and benefits of interventions on our fundamental needs (i.e. water, health, etc.). They share calculations of how society&rsquo;s finite resources should be spent for use in policy decisions. But the systems approach, which urges action based on risk assessment, is being constrained by demands for better predictions. At the center is a gap between what we worry about and what will actually change outcomes. Bangladesh, for example, is badly affected by changing climate, and some scientists argue that instead of refining a 50-year climate forecast, efforts should focus on calculating when people should abandon their land in floods, to move seeds and tools to higher ground. This session discusses how we decide what to prepare for. Can science and policy be aligned on these issues or are they in perpetual tension?</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7062</td><td>Earth Observation Data Goes Open Access</td><td>Facilitating the access and the uptake of Earth observation data by a wide range of user communities and boosting their use for society are the key objectives of the Group of Earth Observation (GEO) in setting up the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In the 2010 Beijing Declaration, GEO members committed to implement the GEOSS Data Sharing Principles by developing flexible policy frameworks that enable a more open data environment, which has influenced national and regional data policies including INSPIRE and Copernicus in Europe and Landsat in the United States. GEO has set ambitious strategic targets and is making significant progress toward delivering them. Global and regional initiatives, such as AfriGEOSS, the Asian Water Cycle Initiative, the Blue Planet initiative, the GEO Biodiversity Observing Network, the Global Agricultural Monitoring initiative, the Global Carbon Observing System, the Global Forest Observing Initiative, and the Global Mercury Observation System have been created to address gaps in our capability as identified by users. This session discusses GEO achievements so far and perspectives on the possible extension of its mandate in view of a full implementation of GEOSS.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7066</td><td>Stakeholder Engagement in Science: Strategies, Experiences, and Implications</td><td>Stakeholder engagement has gained attention as a tool available for decision-makers to improve public communication, transparency, trust, and understanding of scientific issues under deliberation. Stakeholders may come from a variety of constituencies, including potentially regulated industries, state and local governments, and the general public, typically represented by community groups and/or non-profit organizations with shared interests. However, building stakeholder engagement into processes may raise concerns about potential delays for releasing products or making decisions. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the implications and effectiveness of various types of engagement. Additionally, the inherent diversity of a stakeholder population can create a challenge for meaningful and equitable engagement, particularly on scientific issues where stakeholders may have varied levels of understanding. This symposium discusses stakeholder engagement strategies used in different environmental and public health programs and evaluates the contributions of these strategies. Panelists will identify stakeholder populations and discuss lessons learned, addressing how to balance the benefits of stakeholder engagement with the implications for process and project management and how stakeholder engagement results in more effective risk communication with increased transparency, trust, and public support for decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The northern high latitudes warm twice as fast as the rest of the world, Greenland glaciers release hundreds of gigatons of ice into the ocean each year, and polar ecosystems are backing out. What was formerly a vast and icy desert, home only to polar bears and to people who have adapted over centuries to this hostile environment, may soon become an area for thriving economic activities. While some see their traditional way of life made impossible or a unique natural heritage endangered, others are already reaching for the treasures that were buried under Arctic sea ice and glaciers as their melting makes oil, gas, and other raw material accessible. The ice-free ocean offers a tempting shortcut for shipping routes to Asia. Climate change in the Arctic may offer economic opportunities, but dramatic run-away effects in this vital and vulnerable part of our planet may well kick the entire Earth's climate system out of balance. What are the knock-on effects of Arctic change on other parts of the world regarding climate, ecosystems, economy, and geo-strategic issues? How can societies deal with the tension between the desire to preserve and the lust to exploit?</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7071</td><td>Rhythmic Entrainment in Non-Human Animals: An Evolutionary Trail of Time Perception</td><td><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Fn;">There is increased research interest in the temporal dynamics of real-time behavior, a pathway that offers enriched opportunities to study fundamental determinants of animal communication systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Because </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">temporal processing is the underlying component of many neuronal networks in animal brains, there is strong support that many characteristics encompassing communicative behaviors are in some way influenced by time.

Technologies that uniquely operate according to the laws of quantum mechanics hold the promise to revolutionize the way we live, work, communicate, and compute. Potentially these could significantly outperform today&rsquo;s technology and perform tasks that many thought impossible. Some of today&rsquo;s most innovative technologies already rely on our world operating with quantum mechanics&mdash;the laser, transistor, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&mdash;have an element of our quantum world. A second, more powerful, quantum revolution is underway. Theoretical and experimental developments in quantum information and the race to build the elusive quantum computer continue to spark new technologies with near- to medium-term commercial applications: materials science, biomedical imaging, personal medicine, ultra-secure communication, oil exploration, drug design, etc. The potential for a tremendous technological and economical impact of quantum information is undisputed. Patents are being filed, venture capital funds focused on quantum technology are appearing and spin-off companies are being created; quantum technologies are no longer the work of science fiction. They are reality and are already transitioning from the laboratories to the marketplace. This symposium highlights some of the cutting-edge innovations in quantum technologies: quantum cryptography, quantum electronics, and quantum sensors.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7074</td><td>Artificial Tissues Engineered To Improve Patient Well-being</td><td><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The worlds aging population requires the development of new treatment strategies for diseased, defective, or damaged tissues.

Therefore, there is a need for smart materials that can be used to replace and repair tissues to be developed. With better tissue engineering possibilities becoming available, improved methods to visualise the fate and effects of these implants are essential and need to be examined. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) is a multidisciplinary field where scientists need to cut across traditional fields of study.&nbsp;It unites researchers from industry and academia with expertise in material choice, cell biology, and clinical translation to successfully design and clinically implement engineered tissue.

No other species disposes of such fine-tuned social interactions, enabling the "human animal" to create complex societies and economies. To make this complex cooperation work, it needs elements of human social behavior like empathy, fairness perceptions and betrayal aversion. This session focuses on recent findings in social neurosciences and behavioral economics on the physiological and cultural foundations of these traits of human social behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7084</td><td>Analogical Processes in STEM Learning</td><td>Scientific discovery and innovation requires a high level of scientific understanding, as well as the ability to see connections across fields. Analogical processes are central to both of these goals. Research in psychology and education has shown that the ability to notice and process analogies within and between domains is central to innovation and discovery. This session shows how analogical learning processes can improve understanding of key principles of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This session will present three innovative research projects that use analogy in different ways to support STEM learning. The first talk shows that analogical comparison can support learning fundamental strategies of scientific reasoning, such as formulating hypotheses and evaluating evidence. The second talk investigates the use of analogy in classroom mathematics teaching, and finds that incorporating techniques designed to facilitate analogical comparison improves children&rsquo;s success in understanding classroom mathematics lessons. The third talk presents studies done in museum settings, in which children gained understanding of a basic engineering principle through analogical comparison. By encouraging young learners to use analogical mapping processes, we can improve their understanding of scientific principles and prepare them for further analogies that may lead to new discoveries.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7092</td><td>Deep-Ocean Industrialization: A New Stewardship Frontier</td><td>The deep ocean is an area of accelerating economic interest, as well as a provider of key ecosystem functions and services. Increasing global demand for fuel and seafood has led to industrial extraction deeper and further offshore than ever before. As land-based economic options diminish, there is renewed and growing interest worldwide in extracting precious metals, methane gas, and rare minerals. Leases to explore for and potentially extract seabed minerals are being granted for hydrothermal vents, seamount crusts, and manganese nodule fields in the deep seafloor of the Western Pacific and in the international seabed area managed by the International Seabed Authority. The seafloor has long been a receptacle for terrestrial debris, waste and mine tailings. But now deep waters are warming, acidity is increasing, and in some regions oxygen is declining, compromising key provisioning and regulatory services as well as resilience of deep ecosystems. There is a growing imperative to manage the deep sea from a multi-sectorial and cross-disciplinary perspective, to safeguard the marine environment while enabling sustainable use. This session examines the innovations needed to manage the deep sea: approaches to minimize harm, allow observations, and facilitate scientific discovery; novel economic, legal, and policy tools; new enforcement mechanisms that are legal and technological; and the capacity building needed to raise awareness and provide environmental justice globally.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7093</td><td>Unlocking the Power of Big Data by Integrating Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences</td><td>The current rapid expansion of biomedical data is often referred to as a data tsunami and represents both a challenge and an opportunity for quality healthcare. The rise of 'Big Data' comes from a variety of sources including the increase in large volume data sets such as genomics, the expanded use of high-dimensional data sets including electronic health records, and the increased use of mobile applications and wireless devices to monitor a variety of data types. The volume, variety, and velocity of data generation all contribute to the &lsquo;Big Data&rsquo; problem. Specifically, the explosion of data creates challenges ranging from acquisition and processing, to storage and transfer, to analysis and visualization. The overarching challenge of the &lsquo;Big Data&rsquo; paradigm in the biomedical sciences is how to convert data to increased understanding and ultimately improve the detection and treatment of diseases. This session focuses on how bringing together perspectives from the physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering can lead from &lsquo;Big Data&rsquo; to knowledge, and ultimately drive discovery and innovation. Applications of 'Big Data' to a variety of aspects of science and medicine will be discussed. Presentations cover topics in crowdsourcing scientific problems, the use of large scale and high-dimensional data sets to address complex problems, applications of 'Big Data' in healthcare and education, and the use of integrated computational models to derive knowledge from data.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7094</td><td>Convergence Science: A Revolution for Health Solutions</td><td>In the area of biomedical research, breakthrough potential lies at the intersection of the life sciences, the physical sciences, and engineering. This deliberate collaboration, known as convergence science, has inspired leading U.S. research institutions&mdash;including Stanford University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Harvard University, University of Michigan, University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology&mdash;to develop dedicated multidisciplinary centers on their campuses. Convergence science&nbsp;examines the promising yet uncharted areas&nbsp;of cell-based therapeutics, nanobiotechnology, engineering approaches to microbial threats, imaging at all scales, immunoengineering, and microbiome engineering. The first portion of this session will discuss the promise and challenges of the convergence approach and, specifically related to health, the integration of digital medical records and social media for patients. Breakout sessions will then enable in-depth discussions on the challenges faced by universities in the structural design of such research centers, the financial and technological barriers to joint research endeavors, the promise of precision medicine and the integration of digital medical records and social media for patients, and an integrated approach for how convergence might fit into the U.S. scientific funding and biomedical research portfolio.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7096</td><td>The Ocean Tracking Network: Global Innovation in Technology, Science, and Management</td><td>Ocean biological resources play a critical role in the global food supply and economy. Fisheries historically have been a reliable resource, but have declined due to over-exploitation, other anthropogenic impacts, and unexpected ocean regime shifts. To sustain these resources, and to manage the competing impacts brought by new ocean development and environmental change, requires credible scientific information on the global movements, survival, and habitat use of valued marine species, and how all are impacted by environmental variables. Advances in acoustic and satellite telemetry and in management and visualization of large data sets are now making it possible for scientists to acquire this information. In 2008, the creation of a new global acoustic telemetry infrastructure was initiated by the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN). OTN is a worldwide partnership of researchers documenting the movements and survival of valued marine animals and linking them to oceanographic conditions. OTN deployments complement existing efforts by global partners and, through an integrated open-access data warehouse, are creating an affordable new global ocean observing system for marine animal movements. OTN also incorporates an international network of social scientists that work to define the contributions that tracking data can make to policy and management. This symposium focuses on the successes and challenges of OTN and advances in moving knowledge into policy and management actions.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7102</td><td>U.S. Looks to the Global Science, Technology, and Innovation Horizon</td><td>As science and engineering rapidly advance and more often span a global Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) community, how can the U.S. strengthen its ability to look to the horizon and translate that vision into research and action for scientists, institutions, industry, and government? Looking to the horizon implies at least three different activities: looking up from a focused, discipline- or institution-based view; looking out to see what other countries are doing, especially in terms of potential STI collaboration; and looking ahead to understand trends being driven by transformational technologies at the STI frontier. The U.S. bottom-up, discipline-based system of research and development, coupled with a can-do, merit-based approach has long yielded unrivaled creativity and innovation. The excellence and size of the U.S. scientific and industrial communities meant that its scientists and institutions rarely looked outside the U.S. and rarely faced strong international competition for new ideas, infrastructure, or funding. Given the emergence of high-impact interdisciplinary fields and recent large STI investments by many nations, how can we complement and fortify the U.S. bottom-up structure within and across universities, industry, and government, and increase the ability to gather, analyze, synthesize, and share institutional, national, and global STI information? This session includes academic, industry, and government leaders at the forefront of understanding the global STI landscape.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7103</td><td>Scholarly Publishing Innovations and Evolution: Views of the Stakeholders</td><td>The publication of scholarly journals remains the primary form of the certification, dissemination, and preservation of the results of scholarly research. This communication medium was an early adapter of online distribution and other web-based resources. The publishing enterprise continues to evolve rapidly, both as it continues to explore and embrace opportunities presented by the online medium, and as it responds to pressures to widen public access. This panel examines recent developments in scholarly publishing from the standpoint of three key stakeholders: the university, library, and publishing communities. The moderator and presenters were members of the Scholarly Publishing Roundtable, a panel that presented recommendations to the U.S. Congress and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on how U.S. federal funding agencies should promote wider access to scholarly publications.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7105</td><td>New Millimeter-Wavelength Insights into Galaxy Evolution in the Early Universe</td><td>Galaxies are the fundamental building blocks of the universe. Understanding how they formed in the early universe and have evolved through cosmic time is one of the primary goals of modern cosmology. Galaxies are now thought to have evolved in a non-linear manner by episodes of accretion, intensive star formation, and supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity triggered by large-scale phenomena such as galactic mergers. When the universe was just a billion years old, &ldquo;starburst&rdquo; galaxies converted vast reservoirs of gas and dust into new stars at a furious pace&mdash;many thousands of times faster than normal spiral galaxies like our Milky Way&mdash;creating SMBHs and near-solar elemental abundances. This symposium focuses on the enormous progress being made in our understanding of galaxy kinematics, structure, and evolution in the early universe through exquisite observations being acquired with new, state-of-the-art centimeter- and millimeter-wavelength telescope systems such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile, the South Polar Telescope in Antarctica, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy in California, and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7107</td><td>Optics and Photonics: An International Perspective</td><td>Optics and photonics technologies are central to modern life; indeed, UNESCO declared 2015 to be the International Year of Light. These technologies enable the manufacture and inspection of all integrated circuits. They give us displays on our smartphones, optical fiber that carries the information in the Internet, advanced precision fabrication, and medical diagnostics tools. Optics and photonics technology offers the potential for even greater societal impact over the next few decades. Solar power generation and new efficient lighting, for example, could transform the energy landscape, and new optical capabilities will be essential to supporting the continued exponential growth of the Internet. Optics and photonics technology development and applications have substantially increased across the globe over the past several years. The European Commission has selected photonics to be one of six key enabling technologies and the U.S. National Academies recently released the report<i> Optics and Photonics: Essential Technologies for Our Nation</i>; both efforts showing the importance of optics and photonics to our global economic future. This session examines the grand challenges and the future potential of optics and photonics in an international as well as an economic perspective.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7108</td><td>Building National Capacity in Science Communication for STEM Graduate Students</td><td>Along with research excellence, effective science communication is an essential skill needed by the science workforce of tomorrow. To engage more effectively across disciplinary boundaries and at the interface of science and society, next-generation scientists must be ready to recognize the &ldquo;so what&rdquo; of their science and be equipped to share it with varied audiences using many diverse channels. However, building systemic communications capacity will require academy-wide buy-in and changes in the funding mechanisms that support graduate education. In 2013, COMPASS conducted a survey of existing communications training opportunities for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduate students and convened a workshop to explore how to systemically improve the quantity and quality of such training. This session builds upon the findings of the workshop by setting the stage for STEM graduate education at a crossroads; discussing communication capacity as a core professional component necessary in a changing workforce; introducing the challenge of scaling, including aligning expectations of core communication competencies and evaluation techniques, along with ensuring connectivity between people and institutions; and providing case studies as examples of how large-scale change might occur. The material presented will motivate a discussion on how to move forward, integrating panel feedback with ideas for actionable steps from audience members.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7109</td><td>Preserving Our Cultural Heritage: Science in the Service of Art</td><td><span face="Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial" style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;"><span>In 2009 a group of chemists and materials scientists from a wide range of institutions came together for a workshop on &ldquo;</span></span><span><span face="Cambria" style="font-family: Cambria;">Chemistry and Materials Research at the Interface Between Science and Art,&rdquo; co-sponsored by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the National Science Foundation. One of the workshop conclusions was that scientists in academia need to be encouraged to collaborate with their peers in cultural heritage institutions, to both increase scientist knowledge of this heritage and also to develop the necessary tools and apply the science to be able to preserve it. The session covers different collaborations that are ongoing in this area, relating to different mediums of art and different technologies that can be applied. The session will also include recent results and successes in this process, both in better understanding of materials as well as in developments for their conservation. The discussion will also address what is needed for collaborations like this to continue to flourish and grow.</span></span></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7113</td><td>Innovative Vehicles for Vetted Information in a Wiki World</td><td>This symposium highlights how societies and foundations are working effectively in a new media landscape to build awareness and appreciation of science by sharing authoritative, scientist-vetted information via new media, coordinated outreach campaigns, and global reach. The reduction of traditional science and health journalism has led to the emergence of new communication platforms, and an organic online culture that engages readers as news consumers, creators, and distributors. This change creates a challenge to ensure that authoritative and accurate information is widely disseminated, opening up opportunities for scientist-organizations to fill the space. Attendees of this symposium will hear from project leaders from interdisciplinary fields&mdash;neuroscience, medicine, and the physical sciences&mdash;that effectively take advantage of new dissemination venues to counteract misinformation with accessible, accurate material. Speakers will provide an overview of their projects, describe how these initiatives have reached audiences from around the globe, and discuss how their projects have made accessible scientific information available directly to the public. This session will compare and contrast approaches, explore avenues for global collaboration in this emerging sphere, and engage attendees in discussion.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7120</td><td>Web-Based Technologies Change International Research Collaborations</td><td>This session explores recent and emerging web-based technologies that connect scientists internationally by building the basis for collaboration through knowledge exchange, access to funding, and crowd-sourced discovery. It will present a new, crowd-sourced platform for finding internationally available research funding opportunities; insight into Mendeley, a rapidly expanding service and application programming interface (API) that manages references and connects scientists globally; the technology base for the work of Scientist Without Boarders to mobilize researchers in response to global challenges; and an analysis of technical barriers to searching and downloading the more than 10 million full-text peer-reviewed publications in the world&rsquo;s digital repositories.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7121</td><td>Variability in Speech and Language in Individuals with Autism and Associated Traits</td><td>Individuals on the autism spectrum are characterized by deficits in social interaction, communication, and behavioral flexibility. Recent studies have shown that autistic traits are not restricted to individuals who have clinical diagnoses of autism. Research has focused on identifying markers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the associated traits (the broader autism phenotype, or BAP) in auditory and language processing, particularly in the domain of pragmatics and discourse. Until recently, however, few studies have looked at the impact that autism spectrum and associated traits have on speech perception and production. Also not yet fully explored is how these findings inform the broader inquiries concerning the nature of human linguistic abilities. Are the differences in linguistic behaviors a reflex of a broken language &ldquo;faculty&rdquo; or should they be thought of as quantitative extremes of the normal distribution? This symposium reviews the most current research in the field and considers its implications from linguistic, psychological, and neuropsychological&nbsp;perspectives.&nbsp;The findings highlight the tremendous variations in linguistic abilities among individuals with varying degrees of autistic traits on and off the spectrum. Better understanding the sources of this variability will not only inform future studies of autism, it will also contribute to better appreciation of the complexity of the human language faculty.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7126</td><td>Approaches for Ensuring Children's Environmental Health Protection</td><td>Protecting and sustaining children&rsquo;s environmental health in today&rsquo;s world requires a systems understanding of the many factors (biological,&nbsp;chemical, physical, and social) that interact during critical windows of development to impact a child&rsquo;s ultimate health and well-being. We are learning how intrauterine and neonatal environmental factors set the stage for lifelong health, and are beginning to understand the epigenetic and molecular mechanisms through which intrauterine stressors such as under-nutrition, toxicant exposure, and social stress may alter developmental programming. Effective public health interventions that both protect and promote children&rsquo;s environmental health require a systems understanding of these complexities, and better methods for assessing cumulative risks that may accrue across the developmental continuum. This symposium brings together the interdisciplinary expertise in developmental and reproductive toxicology, epidemiology, risk analysis, and children&rsquo;s health needed to develop holistic, life course models for children&rsquo;s environmental health protection.&nbsp; Lessons learned from longitudinal cohort studies linking prenatal and childhood environmental exposures to abnormal birth outcomes and child health along the life course continuum, and strategies for translating the research results into guidance for policy-makers , health care providers, and parents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7128</td><td>Integrated Cellular Systems: Building Machines with Cells</td><td>Development of increasingly complex cellular systems will be a major challenge for the next decade and beyond, as we use the knowledge gained from the sub-disciplines of tissue engineering, synthetic biology, micro-fabrication and nanotechnology, systems biology, and developmental biology.&nbsp;This session describes the current state-of-the-art in differentiating source cells from more primitive, pluripotent cells; organizing cells into populations of a single cell type to produce the components or building blocks of higher order systems; and combining multiple cell types to produce greater functionality. As these &ldquo;biological machines&rdquo; increase in capabilities, exhibit emergent behavior, and potentially reveal the ability for self-assembly, self-repair, and even self-replication, questions arise regarding the ethical implications of this work.&nbsp;Future prospects as well as ways of addressing complex ethical questions will be addressed.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7130</td><td>Improvisation for Scientists: Making a Human Connection</td><td>Improvisational theater training is evolving as a promising tool to help scientists communicate more effectively with the public, including policy-makers, the media, students, funders, and even other scientists.&nbsp;The purpose of improvisation is not to teach scientists to become actors or comedians. Instead, the aim is to help them become more dynamic listeners who can focus their attention on the needs of their audience, read unspoken cues, and respond with openness, flexibility, and awareness.&nbsp;Improvisational games engage participants on a personal level, helping them tap into their passion when talking about science, and encourage the use of storytelling.&nbsp;The process teaches that personal connection with science is not inappropriate when talking to the public&mdash;it is imperative.&nbsp;This symposium brings together practitioners who have been using improvisation with scientists in a variety of settings, including courses for graduate students, workshops for medical students, and team-building exercises for scientists in the workplace. Through discussion of experiences, techniques, and challenges, it will provide an understanding of the ways improvisation can be used to help scientists tell their own story and connect directly with people outside their own field.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7131</td><td>The Large Cognitive Implications of Small Languages</td><td>Human infants seem ready to learn any language, arguing for an impressive array of universal language-learning strategies. However, the end result of learning is clearly not uniform. Languages are different, by definition, because speakers of one language can't understand the other. Do speakers process the languages differently as well? This symposium explores several aspects of this issue, with a focus on smaller, often endangered languages: languages are falling silent at a higher rate than bird and mammal species are going extinct. In the meantime, linguists are exploring indigenous knowledge of remaining speakers to better understand how languages can be so different and yet function in similar brains. Function words such as, "the" and "from" are often lost in agrammatic (Broca's) aphasia; what happens when similar brain areas are affected in a speaker of a language like Navajo, that essentially lacks function words?&nbsp;Is expression easier, or is a different kind of grammatical process lost? How do the typical structures of a language change the way information is presented in a sentence?&nbsp;How different is the soundscape of a language that can distinguish words just by choosing one of five pitches for it?&nbsp;How different are sentence processing strategies in small, unwritten languages from those large, written languages that are typically studied? The symposium explores these issues and highlights the urgency of studying them while we still can.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7132</td><td>Guns and Violence: Psychological, Economic, Political and Public Policy Implications</td><td>The factors that lead to gun violence are complex and multifaceted. Over the past decade, there have been a number of high-profile instances of gun violence in the United States and a passionate debate about Second Amendment rights versus public safety.&nbsp;This symposium touches on key factors in this debate by first reviewing the empirical research on policy interventions designed to mitigate gun violence.&nbsp;The impact of mental illness on gun use, including domestic violence and suicide, will then be reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of public policy initiatives.&nbsp;Technological and biometric methods of limiting gun use to legal gun owners will be reviewed, along with the political ramifications of such methods.&nbsp;Finally, the economics of the gun market will be reviewed, with a focus on illegal transfer of gun ownership and the methods available to mitigate such illegal transfers.&nbsp;Of particular relevance to illegal gun transfers are a variety of studies that have implications for gun access by non-authorized users and the burden that such access places on law enforcement officials. This symposium covers the range of issues that impact the use of guns in the U.S. and other countries, and provides a comprehensive assessment of how psychological, economic, political, technological, and public policy factors affect violence in society.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7137</td><td>Rethinking Repatriation of Human Remains: Is It Possible to Move Beyond Conflict?</td><td>The repatriation of human remains is often presented as a fundamental dichotomy between scientists and the claimant communities across which no common ground can possibly exist. With education, understanding, and goodwill on both sides, however, it is possible to bridge this perceived gap and develop a respectful approach to human remains access management that satisfies the needs of both communities. This session focuses on how the remains of past peoples are understood, managed, and used by contemporary indigenous and scientific communities. Its purpose is to explore how, by adopting a more holistic approach, we can achieve more successful outcomes and encourage collaborations rather than conflicts. Presentations will emphasize the importance of the connections between past and present societies, and provide examples of how, by building bridges between archaeologists/anthropologists and indigenous claimant communities, collaborations can be initiated. These types of collaborations can help both communities move away from debates that emphasize differences and toward discussion on the valuable contribution both approaches make to the preservation, curation, study, and veneration of human remains.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7138</td><td>Thinking Skills for the 21st Century: Teaching for Transfer</td><td>A key factor in meeting global challenges is producing college graduates that can use their knowledge and skills; they can synthesize and evaluate, problem solve, and create. When most academic faculty began their careers, little was known about how to develop such skills in students, but these are no longer pie-in-the-sky dreams. Robust empirical evidence indicates that learning environments can be structured in ways that promote such higher order thinking. Cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal skills that support transfer of knowledge and skills to new situations can be taught, along with content. This is true for all students, not just those that are already high achievers. This session updates faculty on the instructional features known to develop students&rsquo; abilities to apply their knowledge and skills in new contexts. Not only will those features be explored, they will be demonstrated within the design of the session; presentations will be kept to a minimum. Participants will be engaged through individual and small group work, will have several opportunities to practice using their new knowledge, and will receive feedback on their performance. Faculty will leave the session having learned six features of instructional design that promote higher-order thinking, having experienced such design features, and having applied their new knowledge to their own classrooms.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7143</td><td>Building Global Partnerships: Sharing Discovery and Innovation, Safeguarding&nbsp;Difference</td><td>A global village, an inter-connected world, a harmonious scientific community: these are some of the well-quoted end points of science diplomacy. As we strive to understand and mitigate challenges in climate change, energy and resource efficiency, health and demographic change, food security, and the digital divide, global partnerships must be built and sustained. It is not easy. Neither is a one-size-fits-all approach always the best option. Protecting difference and promoting winner-takes-all scientific competition is equally important. This high-profile session spotlights decision-makers from Brussels, Cape Town, and Washington responsible for striking this balance and influencing the largest budgets in global science. Their mandate is to place discovery and innovation at the core of international politics. Their success is measured against creating the necessary knowledge, jobs, and growth to see the developed and developing world through the economic downturn. Their goal of achieving sustainable development and alleviating poverty is shared. An important focus will be Africa&rsquo;s determination to not only harness science and technology for the continent&rsquo;s development, but to become a full and active partner in global knowledge partnerships. Progress toward a European Innovation Union with dynamic international cooperation links will be assessed, and U.S. insights into concrete actions and the strong international dimension required will be examined. Best practices and pitfalls will be identified.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7144</td><td>Securing Food, Feed, and Fuel via Natural Diversity: Spotlight on the Maize Genome</td><td>Farmers and plant breeders around the world have always worked to optimize the agricultural plants that support their societies. Given the current trends of climate change, booming human and livestock populations, and increasing demand for biofuels, the pressure on crops and croplands has never been greater. Fortunately, this challenge coincides with an unprecedented moment in science. Innovative, interdisciplinary research programs are poised to deliver knowledge and tools that can help secure food, feed, and fuel for a changing world. Genome-enabled selection can accelerate the breeding of plants adapted for climate change, modified to enhance nutrition, or tailored for more economical biofuel production. Such goals can be achieved by bringing out traits hidden in a plant's own genome&mdash;variations accumulated through evolution, inherited and modified down through the generations, though perhaps not expressed in modern varieties. Tapping this inherent, natural diversity is the key, whether through genome-wide approaches or by targeting links between specific genes and traits. This symposium explains genome-enabled selection, presenting recent advances and highlighting the maize genome. Arguably the world's most important crop, maize has another distinction: a genome exceptionally rich in natural diversity. Thus the story of exploring the maize genome is a paradigm for understanding the problems and opportunities associated with all agricultural plants.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7147</td><td>Leveling the Playing Field: Why Cultural Relevance Matters in Computer Science</td><td>Through the year 2020, computer science (CS) will be one of the only science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines with more jobs available than qualified graduates to fill them. In addition, African-Americans and Hispanics will comprise approximately 40 percent of the US workforce. However, their representation in CS is dismal. These facts illustrate the need to place more students, particularly those of color, in the CS pipeline as early as possible and retain them through baccalaureate degrees. This effort requires a significant investment between K-12 school districts, higher education, industry, and non-profits, and traditional K-12 CS approaches have been unsuccessful. Innovative approaches and programs are required that not only place students of color in the CS pipeline through engagement but also retain them through instruction. This symposium discusses the importance of cultural relevance and equity in K-12 CS education to effectively engage, instruct, retain, and graduate students of color. The panelists comprise the Partnership for Early Engagement in CS (PEECS), a partnership between Howard University, Washington, DC Public Schools (DCPS), Google, and Exploring CS. PEECS is designed to expose every DCPS high-school student to CS prior to graduation. Using successes and lessons learned, the symposium presents strategies for increasing not only the CS pipeline but also the participation of students of color by leveraging the K-12, higher education, industry, and non-profit sectors.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7149</td><td>Resolving Our Greatest Public Health Challenges via Science Diplomacy</td><td>Science-based issues are crucial to the conduct of foreign policy. Countries large and small, developed and developing, express a clear interest in implementing science diplomacy through politics. This is for the purpose of representation, cooperation, resolving disputes, improving systems, and securing the right to science for citizens and our most vulnerable populations. The same applies to global companies and institutions operating in a complex matrix of technical and relational challenges. This symposium tests this theory against the successes and failures of health diplomacy strategies around two challenging issues: global responses to HIV/AIDS; and harm reduction science linked to lifestyle. Panellists with unique, first-hand insights into real-life best practices and pitfalls encountered in public health service will spotlight how new disciplines and voices are being integrated into decision-making. Accepting that societal problems are not necessarily problems with purely scientific solutions, speakers will argue that meeting global challenges demands not only scientific discovery and innovation, but greater inclusiveness and dialogue. Their common cause is to demonstrate that if we accept the potential of science diplomacy as a common currency capable of underpinning today&rsquo;s stakeholder interactions, we must equally leverage control at the highest levels to remove the political barriers that prevent affected populations from accessing services.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7156</td><td>Addiction: Our Compulsions and Brain Reward Systems</td><td>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful to attribute our compulsion for addictive damaging activities, such as overeating, taking illicit drugs, or smoking, wholly to our genetic makeup? Then we could blame our parents for everything! We know it is bad for us,&nbsp;but we still do it.&nbsp;Why? This session explores the latest scientific evidence behind compulsive behavior.&nbsp;Personalized medicine provides plenty of&nbsp;research linking genetics and disease, but establishing a relationship between genetic variation and behavior is trickier. How does over-consumption of high-fat food trigger addiction-like neuro adaptive responses in our brain-reward circuitry? Why are&nbsp;less than&nbsp;25 percent of heroin users proven to be dependent, while other&nbsp;addictive substances need only one try for a permanent susceptibility to addiction to occur? How does nicotine&nbsp;work as&nbsp;the principal reinforcing component in tobacco smoke responsible for addiction? This symposium highlights new research showing that genetics plays but one part, demonstrating that compulsive behavior usually comes about after extended access. As biologically deterministic as that may sound, we all have our aptitudes, traits, and susceptibilities&mdash;and free will can prevail. The speakers contend that the&nbsp;same is true with addiction. This session sheds new light on how the three strands of biological, psychological, and social elements work together and emphasizes the importance of continued global research into many unknown underlying mechanisms.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7158</td><td>Outsourcing Science: Will the Cloud Transform Research?</td><td>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), also known as &ldquo;software on demand,&rdquo; is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are located in the cloud rather than a user&rsquo;s desktop or institution. First proposed as a cost reduction mechanism,&nbsp;SaaS has been widely adopted in industry as a disruptive technology.&nbsp;Businesses operate fundamentally differently&nbsp;today&nbsp;than just five years ago because of the rise of SaaS. Startups, larger companies, and consumers all outsource major information management and manipulation tasks to cloud providers. This symposium&nbsp;investigates the question of whether, how, and when a similar transformation may occur in science. In principle, challenging needs and limited budgets should create strong pressures for outsourcing many research functions&mdash;driving, perhaps, the complete relocation of laboratories to the cloud. In practice, we see far less adoption of such technologies in the research community. Is this limited adoption due to fundamental properties of science or alternatively to complacency, conservatism, funding models, and/or university bureaucracy? The answer likely contains shades of all these theories and many more. This symposium&nbsp;brings together pioneers in the research SaaS field to discuss what has worked and what has not, and to identify challenges going forward.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7167</td><td>Innovation in Community Deployment of Water Technologies</td><td>The symposium focuses on innovation associated with the deployment of low-cost water monitoring and water treatment solutions for communities, particularly relevant to developing countries and within developed countries with a limited resource setting. Historic data suggest that in most cases a mere technology-focused solution has failed or has minimal uptake in communities. The symposium brings together leading scientists and technologists in water management, end users like government, municipalities, public health officials, non-governmental organizations, and social scientists to discuss innovative strategies for deployment of water technologies that are sustainable, environment friendly, and create &ldquo;healthy communities.&rdquo; Key scientific issues &nbsp;include the use of local solutions and know-how for water management; a holistic approach toward the supply-demand of the water market and community focus technology development cycle; and the challenges faced by the emerging technologies in field-scale deployment and its uptake by the community.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7174</td><td>Globally Shipped But What&rsquo;s in the Box? Innovation for Better Container Security</td><td>More than 10 million container shipments enter the U.S. each year, but what&nbsp;could be&nbsp;hidden in a cargo container? Detecting human beings, chemicals, biological agents, radionuclear materials or illegal weapons sometimes resembles the search for a needle in the&nbsp;haystack of a million containers in circulation worldwide. Manual customs inspection is time-consuming and inefficient in economic terms. The U.S. Congressional requirement for 100 percent container screening is an ambitious goal and the horizon for its implementation is still unclear. New technologies, including satellites, electronic seals, integrated anti-tamper systems, new container materials, and logical itinerary analysis, provide complementary approaches. In a wirelessly connected world, there will be many opportunities to trace and track containers in the future. The session highlights recent research results that help to answer &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the box?&rdquo; without the need for manual inspection and with increased confidence in container security. It will highlight results of U.S. researchers and progress in Europe, providing inspiration on how to overcome&nbsp;drawbacks in today&rsquo;s container security systems based on scientific research. An opportunity to discuss the future of cargo container monitoring, which is a&nbsp;globally connected but technically fragmented challenge in transport security, will be included.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7180</td><td>Solitary Confinement: Legal, Clinical, and Neurobiological Perspectives</td><td>Solitary confinement involves isolation of prisoners for up to 23 hours a day, a condition that often lasts for several years and, in some cases, for 20 years or more. Estimates of the number of prisoners held in such conditions in the United States are as high as 80,000. By comparison, less than 50 inmates are thought to be held in solitary confinement in Great Britain. One such prison in the U.S. is the &ldquo;super-max&rdquo; California facility, Pelican Bay State Prison, which houses more than 1,000 prisoners in 8 by10 foot concrete cells with no windows and meal delivery though a slot in the door. Although claims have been made that solitary confinement reduces crime and recidivism, the evidence for this is scant. Moreover, some clinical studies suggest that such conditions can have severe psychiatric and even neurologic consequences for the inmates. This possibility is further supported by studies of prisoners of war, sensory deprivation, and environmental enrichment, and research with laboratory animals in which behavioral assessments have been supplemented with neurobiological analyses. This symposium explores the use of solitary confinement in prison systems, discusses its possible impact, and raises questions about whether it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment according to the U.S. Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, and other national and international conventions and statements.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7184</td><td>People and Computing: On Human-Computer Collaborations for Tackling Hard Problems</td><td>A breathtaking pace of advances over the last two decades has brought computing to the forefront of science, medicine, commerce, and the arts, transforming the way individuals live, work, learn, play, and communicate.&nbsp;However, with the advent of large amounts of data, computational methods for machine perception, learning, decision-making, and increasing amounts of autonomy and automation, people are sometimes squeezed out of the equation even though the integration of humans with computing solutions often yields the most innovative results.&nbsp;This symposium explores the critical role of people in larger computational solutions&mdash;with a focus on recent efforts and opportunities in new forms of human-computer collaboration and symbioses with automated methods designed to work well with people so as to complement their abilities and availabilities.&nbsp;Such efforts include new approaches to visualization, human-in-the-loop strategies for effective monitoring and analysis, principles of mixed-initiative interaction, collaborative computing, and methods for crowdsourcing and &ldquo;human computation.&rdquo; Collectively, these strategies stand to power us forward to solutions for current and future global challenges spanning a host of disciplines, including healthcare, transportation, and energy.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7188</td><td>Changing Earth and Eco Systems in the Antarctic Peninsula</td><td>The region of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is undergoing some of the most dramatic change in environmental character of any area on the planet. Connections to global processes including perturbations in ocean temperature and atmospheric circulation are believed to be related to human induced influences, including stratospheric ozone loss and greenhouse gas emissions. The challenge to the global Antarctic community of scientists is to recognize how far reaching and fundamental the changes in the environment actually are within the earth systems of the AP. To this end a special symposium is proposed for the Annual AAAS meeting to be held in Chicago Illinois in February of 2014. The proponents represent a varied disciplinary perspective, which spans the early days of ecosystem study to more recent investigations on the marine geologic character of the AP. We have invited and received confirmation of participation from global leaders in the disciplines they represent and we believe the symposium topic will attract a broad audience at the AAAS meeting and provide adequate synergy for discussion and further study.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7189</td><td>Challenges in Conducting Risk Based Technology Assessments Globally</td><td>A technology assessment, as defined by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), is the thorough and balanced analysis of significant primary, secondary, indirect, and delayed interactions of a technological innovation with society, the environment, and the economy, and the present and foreseen consequences and effects of those interactions. Technology assessments, as a tool for policy analysis, can be used to answer specific questions about a technology&rsquo;s feasibility or effectiveness, the costs and benefits of a specific technology or technological alternatives, or present and future consequences of technological developments.&nbsp;Technology assessments in the United States were conducted at the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment from 1972 to 1995. Since 2002, U.S. Congress has directed GAO to conduct technology assessments. To date, GAO technology assessment reports include topics such as cybersecurity for critical infrastructure protection and climate engineering. This session focuses on the current status and challenges in conducting technology assessments globally. Topics discussed include the following: What is the current status of technology assessments in the U.S. and internationally? What is the role of industry, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations? How are technology assessments informing policy-makers and citizens, both in the U.S. and around the world? What are key challenges and successes?</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7197</td><td>Creating an Ecosystem for Science Learning In and Out of School</td><td>Improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education have been slow and have not benefitted all equally. The Next Generation Science Standards try to address this problem by stipulating that core ideas in science be learned through eight science and engineering practices. These reform ideas align the U.S. with other countries, but pose significant challenges for classrooms. However, there is a rich array of learning experiences outside the classroom (e.g., museums, science centers, afterschool programs), and recent reports that summarize best practices in STEM education have highlighted the role of out-of-school or informal learning for achieving success in STEM. The growing recognition that successful STEM education is achieved in communities that offer rich STEM learning opportunities outside of schools, and that youth spend less than 20 percent of their waking hours in school, presents a radical shift in thinking and may necessitate equally radical policy shifts, away from trying to &ldquo;fix schools&rdquo; and toward creating community-based opportunities for learning. This session discusses the evidence for including informal science education as a key partner in STEM education.&nbsp;Panelists will discuss the rapidly expanding infrastructure for STEM learning in afterschool programs and describe opportunities for partnerships with such settings.&nbsp;They will also describe appropriate and feasible outcomes for learning in these settings that complement and supplement school-day learning.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7199</td><td>Advances in Citizen Science: Large-Scale Community Engagement for Sensing and Analysis</td><td>With citizen science, volunteers are engaged to help with tracking, analysis, and discovery on scientific projects. Citizen science efforts provide valuable contributions that advance scientific inquiry and knowledge, while engaging and educating volunteers. Examples include enlisting volunteers to help with the labeling of heavenly bodies in astronomical images, identification of birds in the wild, the tracking of neuronal paths through multiple cross-sections in microscopic images, and engaging the public with online games that help molecular biologists find better solutions to protein folding problems. This symposium describes several citizen science projects, focusing on key efforts in astronomy and biology. It includes presentations on the GalaxyZoo and Zooniverse projects, based at Oxford University and the Adler Planetarium of Chicago; work on eBird at Cornell University; and efforts at Microsoft Research to develop computational methods aimed at providing a &ldquo;science of citizen science,&rdquo; with the development of methods for the ideal fusing of multiple contributions via Bayesian inference procedures.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7201</td><td>Learning about People and Society via Analysis of Large-Scale&nbsp;Data on Human Activities</td><td>Large-scale datasets can be used to harvest valuable results and insights about people, society, and the environment. For example, studies of large-scale anonymized mobile phone data have been used to understand patterns of human mobility and to understand the influence of seismic events on a population. In other work, anonymized logs of online search activity have been used to detect interactions among medications, highlighting how such data can be used in pharmocovigilance, and researchers have demonstrated how Twitter feeds can be used to predict the onset of depression in users. This session explores several projects that show how such large-scale, often planetary scale, data can be used as new tools in support of efforts in science and society.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7211</td><td>Evaluating the Global Impact of Research Investments
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"><span><br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"></span></td><td>In this weakened global economy, investments in innovation and discovery face a particularly vexing catch-22: our best prospect for a sustainable environment and increased economic growth lies in investments in innovation, yet research funding faces cuts due to dwindling economic resources. Under these circumstances, it is critical that we are able to identify and understand the value and impact of investments in innovation and then demonstrate this value to stakeholders in order to secure necessary resources. Furthermore, it is important to be able to compare different investment strategies from across the globe in order to arrive at &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; for maximizing the impact of investments while responding to limitations in financial resources. For these comparisons to be most effective, methods for harmonizing or standardizing data collected on research investments and impacts should be examined as a method for making the data interoperable across multiple systems, funding schemas, economies, and states. This session provides several perspectives on data interoperability as well as the needs and requirements of evaluators and stakeholders of research and innovation across the global community.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7222</td><td>Innovation in Global Health Research: Bridging the Knowledge-to-Action Divide</td><td>Building institutional capacity, engaging stakeholders in solution-oriented research, and creating mechanisms for policy dialogues are all recognized as crucial elements to mobilize research on health systems and clinical research for the public good. Yet, challenges in the field of global health research abound. Health systems are fragile, research capacity is strained, and competing government priorities may thwart the implementation of research findings. Furthermore, key enablers of reciprocal relationships among researchers in higher and lower income countries may be absent, reducing the likelihood of innovations being transferred across global settings. This symposium explores and addresses these challenges, using examples of innovative global health research and knowledge translation strategies supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Global Health Research Initiative. Structures that foster knowledge translation, innovation exchange and reciprocal learning within and between countries will be highlighted. This symposium will discuss mechanisms to support the uptake of global health research findings in practice, programs, and policies. The audience will be included in discussion about challenges and opportunities.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7224</td><td>Focusing the Gender Lens on Science and Innovation: Improving Lives and Livelihoods</td><td>Women&rsquo;s activities in food production, community management, natural resources and biodiversity management, child education, and family care put them at the center of development. They are fuel and water collectors, food producers, and users of energy for households and transport. According to the World Bank, women's productive enterprises have lower levels of access to resources such as technology, information, inputs, credit, and training, causing female farmers to have 20 to 30percent lower productivity than males. Worldwide, businesses run by female entrepreneurs have lower levels of productivity than male-managed enterprises. Understanding the contributions women can make to science, innovation, technology, and engineering (SITE) research, policy, and programming&mdash;as well as the role SITE can play in supporting the lives and livelihoods of women and men&mdash;is critical for meeting global environment and development challenges. GenderInSITE is an international initiative to develop SITE-based approaches to meet these challenges. GenderInSITE promotes the use of the &lsquo;gender lens&rsquo; to ensure that science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy and programs are effective, equitable, and sustainable&mdash;and that they reflect the aims, concerns, situation, and abilities of both women and men. Use of the &lsquo;gender lens&rsquo; will contribute to innovative, effective, and equitable approaches to meeting the global challenges affecting the health of both the planet and the people.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7225</td><td>Inventing New Ways To Understand the Human Brain</td><td>Understanding the human brain is one of the greatest challenges facing 21st century science. If we can rise to the challenge, we can gain profound insights into what makes us human, develop new treatments for brain diseases, and build revolutionary new computing technologies that will have far reaching effects, not only in neuroscience. Scientists at the European Human Brain Project, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, and the U.S. BRAIN initiative, are developing new paradigms for understanding how the human brain works in health and disease.&nbsp;This symposium highlights pioneering researchers working to uncover the circuitry of human cognition, identify the genetic roots of disease, unlock the power of Big Data for diagnosis, build a new generation of computing hardware inspired by the brain, and perform revolutionary experiments on a realistic model of the brain that could never be done in animals or humans. It is also the opportunity to discover global initiatives towards understanding the brain.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7230</td><td>Global Excellence: New Drivers and Innovative Solutions</td><td>Excellence in science has, time and again, changed our lives and our thinking. The quest for scientific excellence has become a global driver for scientific institutions. In virtually every country, governments, citizens, and industry look toward science to find solutions to the grand challenges of our time, including climate change, energy and food security, and sustainable resources. None of these solutions will be delivered without a comprehensive research capacity, including pioneering research and groundbreaking ideas. Yet, an important risk when addressing society&rsquo;s need for solutions is the over-prescription and over-direction of research portfolios. There is a need to maintain flexibility and encourage creativity and disruptive thinking while recognizing the need for long-term investments. In consequence, a number of funding programs in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia have begun to support initiatives for scientific &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; that have the potential to radically transform the research frontier and advance the next generation of scientific leaders. This session explores some of the most promising strategies that the U.S., Canada, EU, and Asia have adopted to promote scientific excellence and top-quality research. Speakers will address questions about where global excellence is headed and how best to support and stimulate excellent innovative frontier science.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7235</td><td>Leveraging Resources, Organization, and Collaboration for Breakthrough Science</td><td>This panel presents new research findings on dilemmas and issues of how best to manage human and financial resources for science to raise opportunities and chances for successful and high impact breakthroughs. A critical component of the national innovation system in each country is public research organizations.&nbsp;In the United States, federally funded research organizations are at the forefront of tackling many global problems, including research on climate change, renewable fuels, and developing new kinds of materials.&nbsp;But the question remains as to what is the optimal size? Have they become so large that processes have been set in motion that are counterproductive to their main mission of innovative research? Such questions are also raised at a global level, as national research sponsors increasingly target their resources to focus on enhancing scientific impact and commercial spillovers in strategic emerging technologies. But what are the relationships between research sponsorship and publication impacts and outcomes? Does it matter who funds research? And, what can be learned from the strategies and practices of sponsors who more frequently fund high impact research? As problems become more complex, large research teams have to be constructed with diverse competences, some of which do not exist in the research organization.&nbsp;What are the costs of seeking collaborations externally, and how should more complex networks of projects be coordinated?</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7237</td><td>Is It Possible to Reduce 80% of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy by 2050?</td><td>A variety of organizations and research groups have undertaken analyses in the last four years to suggest how greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced in the range of 80 percent.&nbsp;The studies vary significantly in the mix of energy efficiency improvements, electrification, energy storage, demand-side management, transmission, renewable energy, nuclear power, and fossil energy with carbon capture and storage, and how they provide for fuel demand. The critical assumptions made by each study differ as well. As a whole, these studies indicate that the global decarbonization challenge is much larger than often reckoned. The level and pace of energy system transformation required to meet even 80 percent carbon reduction targets is substantially higher than historical experience, removing any particular technology from consideration is likely to limit the chance of success, and substantial investments in research and development will be required to ensure a range of feasible decarbonization options.&nbsp;This session explores the decarbonization studies with a focus on making the assumptions explicit, relating them to historical experience, and describing key implementation hurdles and solutions.&nbsp;Most importantly, the session identifies the elements common to all the studies, as these are indicative of robust strategies, and highlights the differences to illuminate the kinds of technical, economic, and policy choices we face in reaching the goal of radical emission reductions.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7238</td><td>The Physics of Information</td><td>It is often said that we now live in an information society. What is actually information? A sequence of 0 and 1 symbols, or rather an ensemble of systems with two states encoding these symbols? Presently, even in the most miniaturized computer chip, a binary digit, nicknamed&nbsp; "bit" , corresponds to a complex electronic device housing millions of interacting particles. How should we understand information processing when each bit is carried by a single physical particle such as an atom, an electron or a photon? Inversely, can we consider the motion of all elementary particles as a computation that the universe is carrying on? In the last 15 years, physics has witnessed a rapid development of ideas and experiments, that have illustrated the fundamental role played by information in physical laws. The deep connection between physics and information is exploited in novel types of ultra-sensitive measurements, the development of a quantum computer, and in the now commercially available secure communication systems based on quantum cryptography. This symposium discusses the emerging features of information processing quantum machines.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7239</td><td>Streamlining U.S. Visa and Immigration Policies</td><td>Science is increasingly a global endeavor.&nbsp;&ldquo;Brain circulation&rdquo;&mdash;visiting, studying, and working in another country and attending international meetings&mdash;are essential to the way science operates today. Too often, however, foreign students and scientists seeking to come to the U.S. confront outdated immigration and visa policies that complicate lives and research plans and ultimately damage the reputation and progress of U.S. science.&nbsp;Especially since 9/11, instead of welcoming foreign scientists and STEM students, the U.S. system frequently treats them as potential threats. In addition, immigration policies often require that students who receive advanced degrees in the U.S. must return to their home countries before accepting employment.&nbsp;Other policies place quotas on the number of foreign scientists and engineers that the U.S. allows into the country in a given year.&nbsp;In view of the global competition for technical talent, it is not evident that such policies, which may have made sense in an earlier age, serve the best interests of the country today.&nbsp;The symposium focuses on solutions to the problems of visa and immigration policies affecting scientists and STEM students. A group of scholars and policymakers will examine various approaches to making these policies consistent with the changing needs of U.S. and global science, and their presentations will be followed by an interactive discussion with attendees.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7240</td><td>Securing the Future of Science: Using the Higgs to Inspire the Young</td><td>Big science inspires: a 2009 U.K. survey of physics undergraduates revealed 90 percent of respondents were first attracted to science by the fundamental questions about the universe posed by particle and nuclear physics, space science, and astronomy. Since 2003, the global particle physics community has successfully sought to translate initial interest into firm commitment, with a clear goal to increase the number of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates from high school and university. In the U.K. alone, despite a tripling of undergraduate fees, enrollment in physics rose 8.3 percent in 2012 against an overall 8.7 percent fall in university admissions. The British success is attributed to an integrated national campaign, organized in close collaboration with CERN, and operated as a partnership between the particle physics community, its funding body, learned societies, and educational organizations, with international engagement and sharing of ideas. The campaign, and similar efforts in the U.S. and Europe, involves direct engagement between researchers and students, training for teachers, development of curriculum material, mass media campaigns, and events targeting elected officials and senior decision-makers in government and industry so as to demonstrate the longer-term economic and societal benefits of investment in &ldquo;Big Science." This session includes an overview of these efforts, lessons learned for researchers including assessment and monitoring, and specific examples of successes relevant to other disciplines.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7242</td><td>Emergency Response and Community Resilience via Engineering and Computational Advances</td><td>Emergency response capability and medical preparedness are necessary features of any community or nation. This symposium highlights scientific and technological advances in engineering and information science and their roles in disaster preparedness and emergency response. Massive data collection of pre-earthquake inventory and post-event damage can be carried out using ever more sophisticated and ubiquitous sensing devices. The session outlines an open source model for collecting such data and developing tools to globally assess seismic risk. With an abundance of first-hand citizen knowledge shared via social media technologies&mdash;along with updates, advisories, and directives from official government sources and data automatically collected by technical means&mdash;methods for collecting, combining, managing, sampling, and analyzing such disparate data must be advanced.&nbsp; The session also highlights advances in critical thinking and credibility evaluation in improving social media for disaster response. Effective disaster mitigation and response efforts require real-time information-decision support technology that can rapidly assess the situation and identify people in immediate danger, and swiftly communicate to citizens actions to be taken for their safety and the safety of others. The session describes modeling and computational advances in the development of a real-time dynamic adaptive tool for emergency operations and multi-stakeholders and on-the-ground coordination.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7245</td><td>Hydraulic Fracturing: Science, Technology, Myths, and Challenges</td><td>The rapid growth in domestic oil and gas production from shale resources is having a profound impact on the U.S. energy landscape. However, the development of these resources has not occurred without controversy. These resources have been unlocked through the application of two primary technologies: horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or "fracking". The technique of hydraulic fracturing specifically has come under increased scrutiny by land owners and environmental groups over its uncertain impacts to groundwater. Furthermore, questions remain about the potential long term climate implications of abundant and inexpensive natural gas, especially in light of uncertainties surrounding fugitive methane emissions. Leaders from industry, academia, and the environmental community discuss how science and technology have helped to fuel the shale revolution, debunk myths about hydraulic fracturing, and identify challenges and possible solutions needed to ensure the safe and sustainable development of these resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7247</td><td>The Golden Goose Award: Highlighting the Value of Federal Support for Basic Research</td><td>Federally funded scientific research has increasingly become the subject of scrutiny by politicians and the press. Misunderstood or &ldquo;silly sounding&rdquo; research, while an easy target for those looking to trim budgets, is often much more than it seems. The Golden Goose Award recognizes and celebrates the work of scientists whose federally sponsored research could have easily been targeted by politicians as odd, obscure or wasteful at the time it was first funded, but which ultimately resulted in advances that have had significant impact on society. The inaugural year of the award led to three teams of winners across a spectrum of scientific fields. All represented research that could have been deemed unnecessary or without value at the outset, and yet the results of their research led to the creation of the laser; green fluorescent proteins used daily in the biomedical field to isolate disease; and coralline ceramics, which resulted in limb-saving bone grafts. The Golden Goose Award honors these individuals and, in the years to come, other researchers in the United States who have used federal funded research grants to make an invaluable difference to the nation and to our society. This session focuses on the motivation behind the Golden Goose Award, the work of past award winners, the importance of federal funding for basic research, and often unexpected and unpredictable outcomes.<b> </b></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7250</td><td>Project Teams and Public Expenditures of Scientific Research: An International Comparison</td><td>Public expenditures on scientific research have a key role in the promotion of discovery and innovation.&nbsp;Yet the way in which these investments work their way through to these goals remains largely a black box, because so little is known about the project teams supported by the funding. However, regional effects of major research organizations are widely attributed to the people who work on research projects; as J. Robert Oppenheimer once said, &ldquo;the best way to send information is to wrap it up in a person."&nbsp;The lack of evidence about the contribution of people on project teams to discovery and innovation is largely due to the lack of data; for example, a recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) report on the biomedical workforce noted that members were &ldquo;frustrated and sometimes stymied&rdquo; by the quality of the data available. This panel describes the results of projects that have filled that gap by using data on grants to identify who is supported by research funding.&nbsp;This includes not only chief investigators but also individuals on research teams, including graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdocs.&nbsp;The data are drawn from the STAR METRICS data in the United States, the parallel ASTRA project in Australia, and HELIOS in France.&nbsp;The symposium will present results of statistical analyses that go beyond simply counting patents and publications to measure scientific productivity and explore the contributions of all members of project teams.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7253</td><td>Bio-Surveillance: The Interface of Biological, Physical, and Information Sciences</td><td>In July 2012 President Obama signed the first ever National Strategy for Bio-surveillance that builds from existing capabilities and galvanizes U.S. efforts to identify and understand biological threats. Although focused on disease and pathogen surveillance in the continental U.S., the strategy recognizes the global importance of bio-surveillance. It is absolutely essential that nations are able to quickly detect and characterize a biological threat affecting human, animal, or agricultural health.&nbsp;This ability enables lives to be saved and improved outcomes in various scenarios, including purposeful release of a bio-threat agent, an emerging infectious disease outbreak, pandemic, environmental disaster, or food-borne illness. The ultimate goal of the U.S. bio-surveillance enterprise is the continuous collection and synergistic analysis of data from many disparate sources and the dissemination of actionable information followed by timely decision-making. This symposium discusses current U.S. and international disease surveillance approaches and the three critical challenges of improved diagnostics, predictive and epidemiological modeling, and data integration and analysis for decision support. Speakers will discuss the innovation and discovery needed to realize a successful bio-surveillance enterprise capable of capturing early warning signs and guiding public health decisions.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7254</td><td>Science Festivals as Regional Collaborations: Extending Resources by Working Together</td><td>Achieve more, with less money, in less time. This has become a mantra in science education amidst shrinking budgets and limited resources. Many communities across the U.S. have addressed this by transforming the collaborations inherent in science festivals into larger STEM networks and campaigns. These initiatives often involve dozens to hundreds of collaborating organizations, across broad geographic areas, and each reaching tens of thousands of students and families. Since 2007, at least three-dozen science festival initiatives have formed in the U.S. alone, and many of these are now growing into roles that utilize broad partnerships to maximize the impact of existing resources. This symposium examines the emergence of these regional collaborations through the lens of a variety of organizational types: a science museum, a university, and a corporation. It also examines the history and impact of these collaborations and how they are maintained, and considers their future with respect to science education.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7255</td><td>Innovations in Crystallography Meet Demands in Materials Science, Energy, and Health</td><td>Targeted drug design, auto components and computer memory keep getting better thanks to atomic-scale studies of their molecular structure that enable industry to improve effectiveness, high-performance materials, and storage density. Our daily world is awash with examples of the benefits of X-ray crystallography. Open-access to X-ray lightsources has created a hub of innovation, bringing together industry, government, and academia from dozens of countries in the developed and developing world to focus on global challenges. Crystallography has made inroads toward the control of diseases such as HIV, influenza, and West Nile virus as well as advances toward global sustainability through energy efficient products and farming productivity. Ongoing innovations in microbeams, sample environments and preparation, and serial femtosecond crystallography continue to expand the detail scientists can get about the structure and thus properties and functions of molecules of all sizes. Crystallography has become a truly interdisciplinary field with ties to 28 Nobel Prizes and research in physics, biology, chemistry, mineralogy, geoscience and even cultural heritage. As the world celebrates the U.N. designated International Year of Crystallography, this session will look at advances in the field made possible by X-ray lightsources as well as new research tackling some of the biggest challenges in materials science, energy, sustainability, and global health.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7265</td><td>New Modeling Approaches to Inform Climate Change Understanding and Decision-Making</td><td>Climate models were originally developed to advance scientific understanding of the dynamics of the climate system. Now modeling is being used to enhance decision-maker understanding and to inform policy for climate mitigation and adaptation. These new goals and audiences have led to innovative new methods for modeling climate, the earth system, and human actions. While such models strive for scientific accuracy, their added goal is to be useful for social learning and decision making. This symposium brings together leaders of innovative efforts to deploy state of the science models to enhance our ability to effectively deal with climate change. The models described inform policy decisions directly, serve as platforms for policy makers to consider desired outcomes, and facilitate public participation and deliberation. The panelists will overview the logic and goals of the models they are using and discuss how the models are shaped by the contexts in which they are deployed. They will reflect on the challenges to the modeling craft that arise in these contexts as well as the processes by which the public and political elites engage with models. The session will extract lessons from these efforts about how we can best use models to facilitate social learning for sustainability.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7266</td><td>Use of Digital Games To Support Youth's Engagement with Science and Technology</td><td>In this session, two museums describe projects that draw upon digital, collaborative game play and simulation to foster students&rsquo; interest, learning, and engagement with science and technology concepts as they play out in the real world. The projects focus on topics of broad societal importance&mdash;energy and genetics&mdash;and are designed for middle and high school-aged students. Future Energy Chicago is a collaborative, multi-player simulation that provides an in-museum experience coupled with a pre-and post-visit in-classroom curriculum. GeniGames is a video game that incorporates competitive gaming elements into an existing curriculum designed for high school students. Presenters will also discuss ongoing research studies that investigate how specific gaming and simulation elements can contribute to students&rsquo; understanding of scientific concepts. Research examining longer term impacts of these games-based experiences on cognitive dimensions of students&rsquo; learning, and affective dimensions such as motivation and engagement will also be discussed. Research results will be based within the field of the learning sciences&ndash; applying techniques and frameworks from the fields of child development, psychology, science education, and more to insure a wide range of applicability to other settings.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7269</td><td>Innovative and Integrated Approaches To Reducing Malnutrition</td><td>As worldwide hunger and malnutrition concerns in the coming decades drive the global agricultural development agenda and policies, nutrition objectives must be integrated to better ensure healthy outcomes for people in developing countries. Stunting, a severe form of malnutrition characterized by low height-for-age, presents a major hurdle to development efforts. Stunted children have reduced productivity and lifetime earnings, and are faced with increased risk of infectious diseases and greater likelihood of poor school performance. &nbsp;So far, development efforts have focused on increasing agriculture productivity, income, and food supply in order to reduce stunting; these efforts, while effective, only provides about 25 percent of the solution. Areas that have been ignored in development practices and policies offer an opportunity to solve the problem of stunting. This session explores three key interrelated factors that directly or indirectly affect nutritional outcomes based on new emerging scientific evidence:&nbsp; water, sanitation and hygiene; gut microbiome and human health; and mycotoxin/aflatoxin food contamination. New innovation and discoveries in nutrition research could help direct more effective agricultural and nutrition development policies, and programs should consider these factors to better ensure improved nutrition among smallholder farm households and their communities</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7273</td><td>Elections Through the Lens of Mathematics</td><td>This session features an interdisciplinary approach to a wide range of issues related to electoral systems. Elections are recognized as cornerstones of democracy. Yet today there are increasing calls to change our electoral systems, and criticisms of past practices are attracting more and more adherents. Ideas for reform include changes not only to the information that voters are asked to enter on their ballots, but also to the way information on ballots is combined to determine a winner. The most important properties of electoral systems, those that determine how well the winner reflects the voters&rsquo; preferences, can be formulated mathematically. So far, no electoral system free from undesirable properties has been identified, suggesting that the choice of an electoral system amounts to a trade-off of properties. This session explores the difficulty of finding and implementing a &ldquo;good&rdquo; electoral system. Even such simple desiderata as &ldquo;one-voter, one-vote&rdquo; have proven extremely difficult to achieve in practice. Mathematical study of such fairness-related properties typically finds systems that are successful on some dimensions but unsuccessful on others. Simulation or empirical study can be used to assess the frequency with which properties fail under particular electoral systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7274</td><td>Chemistry and Materials Science of Solar Energy Utilization</td><td>Recent discoveries in materials science and associated means of fabrication are yielding capabilities that have the potential to transform prospects for the broad scale adoption of solar energy technologies as a major source of electricity. These advances flow both from the discovery of new material systems as well as the emergence of new ways for using well established materials in forms that can enhance performance, lower cost, and facilitate deployment/installation. As a result, it is no longer a fanciful thought that sustainable solar energy technologies can, in the near term, provide an abundant and low cost contributor to a nation's energy needs.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7275</td><td>Talking to Kids Really Matters: Early Language Experience Shapes Later Life Chances</td><td>There are substantial differences in language proficiency among children that are already evident in infancy.&nbsp;By kindergarten, this gap has widened: many children from disadvantaged backgrounds have fallen way behind their more advantaged peers in verbal and other cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, disparities that are predictive of later academic success or failure.&nbsp;Where do these differences come from?&nbsp;Language abilities are influenced to some extent by genetics, but aspects of early experience associated with socioeconomic status (SES) are also hugely influential&mdash;in particular, SES differences in the home language environment experienced by young children. Observational studies have shown that the sheer amount and quality of caregivers' verbal engagement with infants and toddlers are linked to later cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes and school success in both monolingual and bilingual children.&nbsp;This session presents new experimental research exploring the mechanisms that underlie these powerful effects of early experience on language learning, with the goal of examining their origins, consequences, and social policy implications from the diverse perspectives of neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, education, and economics. Understanding more deeply how early experience affects childrens', and thus nations', economic outcomes provides a scientific basis for&nbsp;more effective intervention and for innovation in public policy that will benefit children and, ultimately, nations.

This multidisciplinary symposium explores questions, issues, innovations and research at the forefront of cybersecurity, infrastructure protection, identity monitoring and management, biometric identification, and health concerns in biodefense, among others. This broad spectrum of issues will be framed by asking cross-disciplinary questions: &nbsp;How can one integrate emerging physical and cyber security technologies in process and facility control systems for critical infrastructures? How do biometric identification systems and real time facial recognition help improve security in airports, banks, law enforcement, identity fraud, and how is this sophisticated identity information managed utilizing integrated information technology software?

What are the social and environmental impediments? This symposium features a discussion with Danish and U.S. colleagues on the technical, economic, and social feasibility of renewable energy microgrids, and investigates issues that may arise from interconnections with utility macrogrids.&nbsp;The discussion is framed in the context of the Danish government&rsquo;s implementation of a program to enable the energy demand of Denmark be based entirely on renewable resources by 2050. The symposium looks at the issues involved in public acceptance of such strategies, and how one needs to inform the public of options based on scientific fact and not on opinion. Speakers will discuss the design, implementation, behavioral, and public policy aspects of microgrid installation and operation, and the feasibility of a microgrid generation strategy for addressing national energy needs. The panel will then discuss the roadblocks ahead at incorporating renewable energy resources into a national electrical grid.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7292</td><td>The Big Thaw: Impacts on Health of Marine Mammals and Indigenous People in the Arctic</td><td><span style="font-size: medium;" size="3"><span face="Calibri" style="font-family: Calibri;">Nowhere in the world has climate change had a greater impact than in the Arctic.&nbsp;Understanding the effects global warming is having on marine productivity and consequences to higher trophic level organisms in the Arctic pales in comparison to existing biophysical datasets mapping global warming and its effects on regional climate, meteorological, and oceanographic changes.&nbsp;This session details how recent oceanographic changes have disrupted a fragile Arctic &ldquo;status quo,&rdquo; dramatically impacting the health and resilience of marine mammals, wildlife populations, and indigenous people in the North. It will focus on seals, walrus, and beluga as landmark sentinel species to illustrate the consequences of a changing marine ecosystem, and how it is critically affecting the health and sustainability of marine mammal populations and the indigenous communities of wildlife and people that depend on their survival.&nbsp;The dynamic and complex nature of these interactions will be illustrated by case studies of unusual mortality events involving ringed seals and walrus in Alaska.&nbsp;Studies of harvested beluga in the western Canadian Arctic have identified the emergence of protozoal pathogens that may impact beluga population health and increase disease exposure to their predators, including indigenous hunters and consumers.&nbsp;Marine mammals are intimately associated with the Arctic and are important sentinels of ecosystem health and indicators of climate change. </span></span></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7301</td><td>Open Science: Reducing Barriers to Scientific Breakthroughs</td><td>Solving global challenges requires scientific breakthroughs from a variety of sectors beyond federally supported research laboratories at established institutions. Scientists in developing regions, afflicted communities, and social entrepreneurs have the potential to contribute diverse and novel solutions to global issues, yet they often lack the resources to advance their own scientific research. The open science movement aims to make research materials, data, and scientific education more accessible, empowering a wider demographic to engage in the global science community. &nbsp;This symposium proposes innovative avenues for engaging a broader scientific community&mdash;from open-source laboratory equipment designs to do-it-yourself medical technologies to public research facilities&mdash;and discusses strategies aimed at validating the impact of these efforts.&nbsp;The panel will provide a range of perspectives to this topic, addressing these issues from the positions of non-profit and academic institutions that forge partnerships to increase diversity in scientific research.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7307</td><td>Harnessing the Immune System: From Bench to Bedside and Back Again</td><td>New technology and cutting-edge research have led to a renaissance in knowledge about the interactions between immune system cells and molecules and their role in controlling disease. Yet an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the immune system has highlighted how much we still have to learn. Many of the more basic biological discoveries are only now being translated into new clinical therapies for global health problems such as cancer and infectious disease. Moving immunology into the clinic is a multi-disciplinary endeavor that draws on cell and molecular biology, medicine, and computational and systems biology. Collaborations among basic scientists, medical professionals, industry representatives, and funding and regulatory agencies are required to advance this field. What researchers learn in the clinic fosters innovation in basic science as well; this iterative process is leading to complete remissions in chemotherapy-resistant cancer patients, preventing rejection and graft versus host disease in transplant recipients, and moving toward treatments in autoimmune diseases ranging from lupus to psoriasis. This symposium brings together experts in cancer immunotherapy, transplantation, and autoimmunity to highlight the therapeutic potential of modulating the immune system with drugs or biological treatments. Speakers will discuss not only where we are and where we have been, but what we need for the next push forward.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7311</td><td>Global Public Health Security: It Takes a Village</td><td>Addressing transnational challenges such as global public health security requires cooperative action between countries and between sectors. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that vulnerability is now universal, especially in times of limited resources and increasing risks, due to our globally connected world. SARS, cholera, avian influenza, the resurgence of dengue, and antimicrobial resistance among bacteria are just a few of these challenges. Populations continue to grow, interactions with our animal brethren become more frequent and familiar, climate change alters the dynamics of disease transmission, and information flows more freely&mdash;making for a complex situation that resists easy solutions. This symposium examines global public health from several perspectives, describing how the global village may attempt to address these challenges. Perspectives include that of an academic working in a developing country, a global health journalist, and a policymaker from a government agency tasked with developing an agenda and funding a research portfolio. The symposium will discuss similarities and differences between perspectives and the complexity of finding solutions for these challenges.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7312</td><td>Teen Caf&eacute;s: Innovative Model for Effective Science Communication with Key Demographic</td><td>The Teen Science Caf&eacute; Network<b> </b>is a growing community creating opportunities for teens to learn from experts about science and technology that is changing their world. Teen caf&eacute;s are informal, interactive programs that promote exploration, creativity, and lifelong learning. Like adult science caf&eacute; programs, teen caf&eacute; programs are highly successful because they engage teens in conversation with scientists. What is different is the added opportunity for hands-on explorations in science and technology. The programs provide teens a rich perspective on the nature of science and a picture of scientists as real people leading interesting lives, which has been a key influencer of positive attitudes about careers in science. This session focuses on key elements for success with teen caf&eacute;s: coaching scientists in public communication and helping them think in new ways about the significance of their own research; engaging teens as leaders of their programs to instill ownership and better ensure the programs are relevant; and infusing hands-on exploration and other interactive elements. The Teen Science Caf&eacute; Network is a dynamic, mutually supportive community helping organizations that wish to start their own teen caf&eacute;. This session will feature current participants in the Network to discuss key aspects of the teen caf&eacute; model, relate their personal experience in the program, and provide guidance on starting teen caf&eacute; programs.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7315</td><td>Statistical Methods for Large Environmental Datasets</td><td>There is great need for novel statistical methods for the analysis of massive environmental data to address challenges that examine the interdependences between multiple processes that influence the biosphere. The statistical challenges within just climatology or atmospheric chemistry or oceanography have been a focus for intense activity; however, considering the atmospheric and oceanic sciences as a whole will allow us to examine the critical aspect of interdependencies between processes. For example, in order to understand climate fully, it is essential to understand weather, atmospheric chemistry, oceans, ice, and terrestrial processes, particularly with respect to the carbon and water cycles. Biological processes and human activities are both affected by and affect climate on local (urban heat islands), regional (land use patterns), and global scales (greenhouse gas emissions), such that a comprehensive study also requires hydrology, forestry, ecology, agriculture, economics and public policy. The development of appropriate statistical models for these processes remains a challenge because of the immense difficulty of accurately capturing dynamic aspects of spatio-temporal processes, especially nonlinear and non-stationary behavior. This session discusses common statistical themes across these major scientific problems and innovations developed to address these challenges.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7318</td><td>Discovery and Innovation: What&rsquo;s the Connection and Why Does It Matter?</td><td>The concepts of discovery and innovation belong together for many reasons. But what, precisely, are &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; and &ldquo;innovation,&rdquo; what is their relationship, and why does it matter? While the answers may seem obvious, appearances may be deceiving.&nbsp;Assumptions about actual and aspirational relations between discovery and innovation require historical, philosophical, ethical, and policy analysis, appropriately embedded within the relevant domains of science and engineering.&nbsp;There are good empirical questions to be asked of the connection between discovery and innovation. Why do we so readily put these notions together? What is the trajectory of their interactions?&nbsp;History and philosophy and social studies of science allow us to problematize and explore the assumptions underlying common understandings of the relationship. Such explorations open further avenues of inquiry, especially into how to organize science and the funding of science to facilitate innovative discoveries. Moreover, insofar as the aim of AAAS is to advance science while serving society, we may become better prepared to evaluate whether and how discovery, innovation, and innovative discovery do advance the public good. This session explores a range of meanings of discovery and innovation and the connections between them, in order to assess better and worse arrangements in science, funding, and policy.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7319</td><td>Accelerating&nbsp;Innovation in the Middle East: Lessons for the Developing World</td><td>The economic value of innovation is widely discussed in the science and technology community, but the science and technology community is less adept at linking innovation to entrepreneurship and business growth. This connection, however, is crucial in the developing world where resources to invest in science, technology, and innovation are more limited and the need for economic development more desperate&mdash;particularly in the Middle East, where political instabilities are exacerbated and fragile democracies threatened by a lack of economic opportunity. The large population of under-employed and unemployed young people in the Middle East is frustrated by the lack of economic growth, and this frustration was a primary spark for the still ongoing transformations of the &ldquo;Arab Spring.&rdquo; Amidst the backdrop of political and social upheaval, many efforts are underway to promote a more dynamic innovation ecosystem in the Middle East by stimulating and linking people, institutions, ideas, and capital; it appears that an entrepreneurial revolution may now be taking hold. This session highlights exciting activities that are encouraging the growing culture of innovation and connecting new ideas in science and technology to business growth. These examples can provide helpful models for development in other parts of the world.

Changes in population and economic growth, innovation, technological development, governance, and lifestyles will affect the energy use and land use that drive climate change, as well as society&rsquo;s capacity to reduce emissions or adapt to climate change impacts. Developing a set of alternative scenarios for societal development is one way to capture and explore the uncertainty in future conditions. The climate change research community is producing a new set of five such scenarios, called Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) intended to underpin scientific studies, assessments, and policy dialogues for the next decade or more. This symposium discusses the overarching scenario framework and the main qualitative features of the five SSPs. Speakers will also present newly developed scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions and land use change based on these societal development pathways, a first look at their implications for impacts on the global agricultural system, and thoughts on how best to improve the scenario framework and research base as it is refined over time.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7322</td><td>Science, Religion, and Modern Physicists: New Studies</td><td><span style="color: #000033;">Recent work on the religious lives and beliefs of leading physicists raises interesting questions about the interaction of science and religion in the modern period. How can religious values and attitudes influence the actual practice of science? How do religious beliefs and experiences shape the ways in which scientists interpret science for non-scientific audiences? These questions are addressed in this symposium, which focuses on three influential scientists who regarded themselves as religious and who wrote about science for wider audiences: Arthur Eddington, a Quaker; Arthur Holly Compton, a Presbyterian; and Albert Einstein, a Jew. </span></td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7324</td><td>Decision-Making in the Public Domain: Boundary Processes as Catalysts for Innovation</td><td>Many natural resources issues are complex, involving competing demands, uncertainties, and risks. Dialogue processes that link scientists, technical experts, decision-makers,&nbsp;and stakeholders can improve the effectiveness of natural resource management. Boundary processes and institutions&nbsp;have important roles in structuring such interactions. Information developed jointly by technical experts, the public, and decision-makers is more likely to be perceived as&nbsp;relevant, credible, and legitimate. Structured boundary processes can also lead to&nbsp;novel frames of&nbsp;the resource &ldquo;problem set,&rdquo; which, in turn, can lead to innovative solutions. The symposium comprises speakers from diverse backgrounds in public service, economics, and the social and natural sciences. For several large-scale controversial issues&mdash;such as hydraulic fracturing, listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act, and management of entire ecosystems&mdash;we illustrate how boundary processes that link experts with stakeholders and decision-makers can enhance understanding of&nbsp;natural resource challenges and help reframe problems and options for addressing them.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7331</td><td>Challenges and Opportunities in Transitioning Small-Scale Fisheries to Sustainability</td><td>Small-scale fisheries are globally important in terms of food and livelihood security, but face key sustainability challenges. These challenges are exacerbated by multi-dimensional and sometimes conflicting management goals such as ecological sustainability, economic efficiency, and poverty reduction. As such, there are disagreements about the effectiveness of different fisheries management approaches, including state regulation, market-based approaches, and collective action approaches, i.e., resource users self-organize to manage fisheries resources. Historically, there has also been a tendency to advocate for one of these approaches as a panacea or silver bullet, regardless of the social, ecological, or institutional context. Emerging empirically driven scientific research on social-ecological interactions in small-scale fisheries can provide guidance regarding which sorts of interventions are most likely to be adopted and succeed. As an important first step to address this, the symposium brings together speakers representing disciplines relevant to this challenge and with different views on these issues. The panel will draw on experiences working within their respective geographies to address the following critical question: Which attributes of small-scale fisheries (social, ecological, and institutional) predict which management approach is likely to be the most successful in a given system?</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7333</td><td>Exploring the Foundations of Magnetism with New Nanoscale Probes</td><td>With the growing use of magnetic nanoparticles in biological systems and magnetic nanostructures in information storage and low-power computation, studies of the small-scale behavior of tiny magnets and their interfaces with other materials have become essential for global challenges in health and sustainability. For example, new magnetic systems may permit single-molecule nuclear magnetic resonance directly through magnetic sensing. This symposium brings together prominent researchers from around the world who are pioneering approaches to probe the foundations of nanoscale magnetism. The smallest length scale envisioned is the atomic scale, where the chemical sensitivity of X-rays can now be combined with the atomic-scale resolution of scanning tunneling microscopes. The largest scale is that of fundamental excitations of magnetic systems, i.e., the vortex scale, where scanning magnetic probes have now visualized a single vortex and probed its pinning dynamics from a single site that pins it in place. In between, the use of exceptionally sensitive, scanning, quantum-coherent probes of magnetic fields can pick up the magnetic field of a few protons in a molecule, or detect the fields of nearby molecules while optically trapped in a biological fluid. The advances in these techniques suggest many problems in physics, biology, and chemistry can now be solved by direct measurement of nanoscale magnetism.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7346</td><td>Rebooting Our Approach to Increasing Indigenous STEM Participation: Lessons from Hawai`i</td><td>As we look toward a future of ever increasing challenges, there is widespread consensus that solutions depend on expanding worldwide human capitol. While we contemplate pathways to increase STEM capacity across multinational settings, we are theoretically hindered by our failure to fully develop the capacity of ethnic and racial groups within our own borders. Indigenous peoples continue to be underrepresented in STEM at one-sixth of their share of the total U.S. population, despite investment of substantial resources from the public and private sectors. At the extreme, Native Hawaiians participate in STEM at rates that are almost incalculably low. An examination of K-12, informal science, and "broader impacts" settings in Hawai'i, suggests that national efforts (e.g. standards-based reform and agency-funded education and public outreach) have been, and are likely to continue to be, ineffective, as these efforts do not address the source of the problem. Instead, speakers suggest that the disparity is ultimately rooted in a failure of relationships. Research across these settings indicates that many current efforts fail to transmit across cultures, and that effective efforts must primarily foster authentic trust and respect between Western and Indigenous perspective-holders. With critical examination of best- and worst-practices, this session focuses on immediate actions that can be taken to positively impact diverse participation in STEM.</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td></td><td></td><td>7349</td><td>Dark Matter Discoveries: Challenges and Innovation</td><td><span></span>
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The recent results from the Planck satellite confirm that a staggering 85 percent of matter in the universe is a new form not accounted for by the Standard Model of particle physics. Leading particle candidates for dark matter are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with mass between 10 and 1000 times that of&nbsp;the proton. The WIMP is strongly motivated by supersymmetry and detectable also as a product of the highest energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.&nbsp;Several experiments attempting to directly detect dark matter particles streaming from space have already reported puzzling results with possible signals. New &ldquo;telescopes&rdquo; like Fermi, AMS, and IceCube can detect&nbsp;WIMP dark matter particles annihilating in space. Major discoveries may be imminent, as a multi-pronged experimental program moves forward rapidly, driving technological innovations for ultra-sensitive detectors. This is a timely symposium at the crossroads of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology that will include a theoretical overview and talks on the latest results and technologies of the leading dark matter particle searches.

Awareness of the economic potential and importance of Canada&rsquo;s enormous oil sands resources have compelled interested parties to initiate infrastructure development plans in both Canada and the U.S. in recent years, with the proposed 1,100-mile long Keystone XL pipeline as an example. The intensified oil sands mining operations in Canada, on the other hand, have raised concerns among environmentalists who hold that these activities would lead to a surge of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Further, public sensitivity following the recent oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has rendered any crude-oil related economic activity a challenging endeavor. Impact of an ongoing public debate has been felt in both nations&rsquo; economic and political circles. The pursuit of technical developments in fields related to Canada&rsquo;s oil sands has been overshadowed by a debate in which everyone, from people living in the most remote regions of Canada and the U.S. to the politicians and lawmakers at all levels of the governments, has an opinion. This symposium examines and explores innovations in genetic engineering, applicable to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, as well as environmental, economic, and geopolitical dimensions of Canada&rsquo;s oil sands operations.</td></tr><tr><td>Clinics</td><td></td><td>For speakers and moderators only</td><td>7549</td><td>Presentation Rx Clinic (Day 1)</td><td>New for 2014, AAAS is offering to symposia speakers, panelists, and moderators individual sessions with an expert Presentation Rx communication consultant (listed below) during the AAAS Annual Meeting, Thursday-Sunday.

Participants will become more effective in using new social media communications tools. This  workshop is designed to improve communications skills and enhance message delivery in an increasingly global research enterprise. </td></tr><tr><td>Career Development Workshops</td><td></td><td></td><td>7407</td><td>Editing Your Own Papers and Proposals: How to Wow Reviewers and Aid Readers</td><td>Papers and proposals that are well edited tend to impress reviewers. They also are easier for others to read. Yet few researchers work at institutions with scientific editors, and hiring an editor can be costly. This workshop therefore presents guidance on editing one's submission oneself. The workshop includes checklists for content, advice on increasing readability, lists of writing errors to avoid, pointers for making wording more concise, and suggestions for non-native users of English. It also identifies resources. For those whose budgets allow, it discusses finding qualified scientific editors. The workshop contains humor and interactive exercises. Come see some ways to help your papers and proposals impress and communicate.</td></tr><tr><td>Career Development Workshops</td><td></td><td></td><td>7408</td><td>AuthorAID: A Service to Use and a Chance to Serve</td><td>Many in the sciences seek guidance in writing and publishing.

These discussions are relevant to decision-makers in governments, international policymakers, relief organizations, private sector, academia, and users dealing with growing population, climate, food supply/demands, weather extremes, agricultural technology, policies, and observational systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></td></tr><tr><td>Seminars</td><td></td><td></td><td>7065</td><td>Perennial Grains for Food Security in a Changing World: Gene to Farm Innovations</td><td>Farmers, particularly those on small land holdings in developing countries, need more options to increase crop and livestock production while also supporting multiple ecological functions such as topsoil retention. These needs must be met under much more challenging circumstances than those under which yields were increased in the first &lsquo;Green Revolution&rsquo;, including&nbsp;rising input costs, diminishing water resources, increased climate variability, and degraded soil conditions. The development of perennial grain crops, such as wheat, sorghum, and grain legumes, has received widespread attention as a potentially transformative innovation that could be a keystone in solutions to these multiple challenges.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In this symposium, international experts report on advances in perennial grain crop development, from cutting-edge genomic innovations to on-farm, real-world results, showing how science is advancing this concept toward practical reality. Talks will cover the history of perennial grain crop development; recent genomic innovations relevant to perennial crop development; early successes in addressing food and ecosystem security issues in sub-Saharan Africa; relevance to climate change, livestock production, gender, nutrition, and natural resource management; and next steps and research needs to advance this work.</td></tr><tr><td>Seminars</td><td></td><td></td><td>7161</td><td>Research and Development for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security</td><td>The United States requires an agriculture system that meets its population&rsquo;s needs for a safe and secure food supply and fosters a culture of innovation and excellence that addresses global challenges for a secure food supply as the human population approaches 9 billion by 2050. The absence of a global solution to food security threatens the long-term prosperity and international security of the U.S. Funding for food and agriculture&nbsp;research over the past 30 years has remained flat while Research and Development (R&amp;D) in all other areas of federally funded research has increased substantially. Given the global challenges in food security, this level of investment endangers the economic vitality of all nations, including the U.S.. This symposium presents a broad array of examples of what R&amp;D can produce, and a perspective on how future challenges developing productive, environmentally sound, and sustainable food and&nbsp;agriculture production systems&nbsp;can be met only with a substantial increase in agricultural R&amp;D.</td></tr><tr><td>Seminars</td><td></td><td></td><td>7205</td><td>How Big Data Supports Biomedical Discovery</td><td>Creating large repositories of biomedical data is acknowledged to be critical to making discoveries and creating innovations in biology, medicine, and health care, but is particularly challenging due to the compliance, security, and consent process required. Sometimes large repositories like these are called biomedical commons. In this session, different perspectives are presented on how to build large-scale commons of biomedical data and how to make these available to a broad international community of researchers. The perspectives highlight some of the technical, legal, policy, and behavioral challenges when creating biomedical commons and some of the solutions that the projects discussed have developed. Technical challenges include the management, integration, indexing, analysis, transport, and archiving of petabyte-scale datasets. Legal and policy challenges include integration of data with different consent policies and the harmonization of different national data privacy policies. Other challenges including providing access to a broad community of researchers, not just those at the major research centers, who were the only ones, until recently, who had access to the computational infrastructure required to manage petabyte-size datasets. The perspectives present cases covering regional, national, and international big data biomedical commons projects.</td></tr><tr><td>Seminars</td><td></td><td></td><td>7214</td><td>Organizing the Innovation System for Advanced Manufacturing</td><td>Advanced manufacturing is the source of most innovation and a critical component of a vital economy with large economic spillovers to other sectors. The sector is becoming increasingly automated and customized, setting the stage for new opportunities for manufacturing at both local and national levels. This symposium starts with two U.S.-centric case studies on the role of additive manufacturing in transforming manufacturing over the next 20 years and how the emergence of robots is changing manufacturing today. The session then shifts to an international perspective to discuss the emergence of advanced manufacturing in China, enhanced by a highly innovative kind of integrated production scale-up capability emerging there. The last half of the symposium identifies the organizational challenges for the U.S. innovation system with an overview of the manufacturing ecosystem and the status of current policies. It includes discussion of major executive branch initiatives using public-private-academic partnership models to provide a new kind of government support for the prototyping/testbed stage of innovation in advanced manufacturing. The symposium provides industry, academic, and science policy views on manufacturing and the challenges facing the United States and other nations.</td></tr><tr><td>Seminars</td><td></td><td></td><td>7327</td><td>Science-Driven Entrepreneurship: Determined Pursuit of Innovative Success</td><td>The impact of a scientific discovery can be gauged by its utility, i.e. the extent to which a broader community realizes benefit. Entrepreneurship is the discipline through which commercial value is built from an initial concept or start-up endeavor. This symposium examines entrepreneurship at a strategic level: Can a historical innovation process keep pace with global urgency in development? How important is entrepreneurship in the overall technology innovation milieu? How is an environment that breeds entrepreneurial successes established? What policies and actions of academic campuses, national laboratories, research institutes, and local government best yield translational benefits? Can entrepreneurship be taught? Are certain entrepreneurial success factors common across a spectrum of technology fields? Will the role traditionally played by venture capital evolve or be replaced? An early-stage company can offer an exciting environment for directed scientific research, technology innovation, and career progression. Businesses with less than 100 employees represent more than 99.7 percent of all employers, employ some 50 percent of the total U.S. workforce, and provide 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs annually. This symposium conveys the excitement and the challenges involved in launching and driving the early growth of a new technology company. Speakers will share entrepreneurial experiences, highlighting success factors involved in progressing an innovation toward real and beneficial impact.</td></tr><tr><td>Seminars</td><td></td><td></td><td>7335</td><td>New Business Models for Accelerating Biomedical Innovation</td><td>
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">There is growing consensus that the process of translating biomedical research into effective therapeutics is broken and that the current business model for life sciences research and development (R&amp;D) is flawed. The trend of increasing risk and complexity within the biopharmaceutical industry implies that the traditional sources of financing&mdash;e.g., private and public equity&mdash;are becoming less effective because the needs and expectations of limited partners and shareholders are becoming less aligned with the new realities of biomedical innovation. The result is a push toward funding projects and strategies with clearer and more immediate payoffs, leaving the more speculative but potentially more transformative science and translational research to languish. In order to address these issues, the seemingly disparate worlds of business and finance and science and medicine must converge; new business models that provide the proper incentives for all key stakeholders to work together toward the common goal of improving biomedical innovation must be developed. This session highlights emerging ideas and concepts with this intent.<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"></span></td></tr><tr><td>Seminars</td><td></td><td></td><td>7504</td><td><span>Engaging with Journalists</span></td><td>

This workshop is designed to assist research faculty in creating concrete, discipline-specific strategies to incorporate research ethics education into the context of the research environment, whether it be a lab or field work. The workshop is grounded in a recognition that many research ethics issues are relevant to the practice and application of science, from developing hypotheses and designing a protocol, to data management and analysis, to reporting findings and advising others on the uses of the work, and that integrating ethics instruction in the context of performing those various stages of research can be an effective strategy for educating future researchers.  Participants will be introduced to rationales, content, approaches, tools, and resources to give them the means to develop and implement research ethics education in their research environment.</td></tr><tr><td>Special Sessions</td><td></td><td>Pre-registration required

Science festivals are proliferating rapidly across the globe, and growing in scope and impact in the communities where they are already taking place. Science cafes are now so prevalent that it is often no longer necessary to explain what they are to other professionals, and local cafes continue to find new ways to reach new audiences. Other eventsoften blending dialogue, storytelling, and celebration (or defying categorization altogether)are emerging in unique communities and adapting to cultural contexts in your own backyard and throughout the world.  Join professionals involved in public science events from diverse fields and across institutional silos for the third International Public Science Events Conference (IPSEC), and add your voice to the conversation about how we make our events instructive, meaningful, entertaining, and culturally relevant.
