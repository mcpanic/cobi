	Accumulating evidence suggests that air pollutants can induce inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain; epidemiological studies report associations of air pollution with impaired cognition and attention, and increased risk for autism and schizophrenia. Since early development is a period of particular vulnerability of brain to such insults, we examined changes in brain development and long-term behavioral consequences of early postnatal (PN) exposure to real-time concentrated ambient particulate matter (CAPS; ultrafine particles) for 4hr/day on PN 4-8 and 10-13, a period of significant neurogenesis and gliogenesis, in mice, &nbsp;with or without an additional 4 day adult (AD) exposure &nbsp;(PN55-59). Mean CAPS count across exposure approximated 200,000 particles/cm<sup>3</sup>, and mean particle mass concentration was 96.4ug/m<sup>3</sup>. Notably, PN CAPS produced lateral ventricle enlargement (ventriculomegaly) that was observed 24 hr post exposure and persisted,&nbsp;findings seen only in males, and sometimes accompanied by coarctation. &nbsp;Ventriculomegaly has been associated with both autism and schizophrenia, and is a predictor of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Interestingly, human studies show that males are more likely to be diagnosed with autism and earlier on-set schizophrenia, paralleling these observations of male-specific lateral ventricle dilation. AD only CAPS also produced ventriculomegaly in males. PN CAPS also reduced levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity in corpus callosum and in hippocampus, along with persistent increases in the microglia marker IBA-1, in males, findings suggestive of glial cell loss and with &lsquo;functional disconnectivity&rsquo;, also a&nbsp;feature of both autism and schizophrenia. Increased GFAP was observed in females, but restricted to early time points, indicating a more transient astrocytic response to PN CAPS. &nbsp;Increased levels of hippocampal glutamate, consistent with excitotoxicity, were seen in both sexes after PN CAPS. Behavioral consequences were persistent and sex-dependent. In males, where behavior was studied more extensively, CAPS impaired learning and short-term memory, increased impulsive-like behavior and reduced locomotor activity.&nbsp; Deficits in learning, locomotor activity and short-term memory&nbsp;were also observed in females. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a vulnerability of developing brain to even low levels of air pollution, particularly in males. Moreover, they raise the possibility that such exposures could serve as risk factors for autism and/or schizophrenia. Supported by NIH R21ES019105.

	Air pollution has been increasingly linked to central nervous system (CNS) disease, but the mechanisms driving this response and the type of exposures responsible are largely unknown. Microglia, the resident innate immune cell in the brain, and peripheral inflammation have been implicated in the progressive nature of neurodegenerative disease, but their role in air pollution-induced neuropathology is poorly understood.&nbsp; Diesel exhaust (DE) is a major component of near-road and urban pollution and has received significant attention regarding its human health effects in both ambient and occupational exposure conditions.&nbsp; To discern the early CNS response to diesel exhaust (DE), adult male rats were exposed to DE (2.0, 0.5, and 0 mg PM/m<sup>3</sup>) for one month by inhalation.&nbsp; DE-exposure elevated markers of neuroinflammation (nitrotyrosine, IL-6, TNF&alpha;, and MIP-1&alpha;) in the midbrain, cortex, and olfactory bulbs, in addition to activation of microglia, as determined by morphology.&nbsp; The highest levels of neuroinflammation occurred in the midbrain, which also contained the highest level of the IBA-1 microglial marker.&nbsp; Neurotoxicity and early markers of neurodegenerative disease were unaffected.&nbsp; One month exposure to biodiesel exhaust revealed only changes in microglia morphology without any elevation of pro-inflammatory factors, demonstrating that neuroinflammation may be exposure specific.&nbsp; &nbsp;In an effort to reveal how DE might be causing neuroinflammation, rats were administered an IT bolus of DE particles (DEP, 20 mg/kg) where DEP exposure elevated serum and brain TNF&alpha;, suggesting a role for the particles in initiating&nbsp; peripheral inflammation capable of transferring to the brain.&nbsp; Importantly, primary microglia cultures treated with DEP (50&mu;g/ml) fail to produce TNF&alpha;, indicating that brain TNF&alpha; production may not be due to the direct interaction of microglia with the particles. To begin to explore the role of long-term exposure on CNS health, we tested the effect of subchronic (6 month) DE (992, 311, 100, 35 and 0 &mu;g PM/m&sup3;) inhalation in rats and found elevated levels of the neurotoxic cytokine TNF&alpha; at lower exposures (DE, 100 &mu;g PM/m&sup3;) and early protein markers of neurodegenerative diseases (A&beta;42, &alpha; synuclein&nbsp; and phosphorylated tau) at higher levels (DE 992 &mu;g PM/m&sup3;), suggesting that subchronic &nbsp;DE exposure may impinge on common neurodegenerative disease pathways.&nbsp; Together, these findings demonstrate that the brain&rsquo;s immune system can detect and respond to DE and support that circulating cytokines may play a role in how neuroinflammation transfers to the brain.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further, these studies indicate that deleterious CNS effects may accumulate over-time to perturb neurodegenerative disease pathways, emphasizing the importance of further mechanistic inquiry.

	The consistent findings that particulate matter exposure is causally associated with the adverse cardiopulmonary health effects of ambient air pollution have prompted a number of mechanistic explanations, including the generation of inflammatory mediators by lung tissue that then travel to other organ systems, the activation of autonomic nervous system responses, and the delivery of respiratory tract-deposited material to other tissues via solid particle (translocation) or solute transport.&nbsp; The deposition of inhaled particles is dependent upon size, but nanoscale particles (&lt;100 nm in diameter, also ultrafine particles) deposit with high efficiency in all regions of the respiratory tract.&nbsp; Studies with very poorly-soluble nanoscale particles demonstrated translocation to distal tissues (e.g., liver, brain) and a dependence on particle size, with smaller particles accumulating to a greater extent, albeit at a small fraction of applied dose. It was hypothesized that brain accumulation could be explained by solid particle transported via the olfactory nerve.&nbsp; A reasonable question, though, is whether or not there are adverse consequences of such accumulation, such as local inflammation or the induction or exacerbation of neurodegenerative processes.&nbsp; Using poorly-soluble nanoscale Mn oxide particles, it was found that markers of oxidative stress and inflammatory cell activation (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a) were elevated in the same regions of the brain where Mn accumulated following whole-body inhalation exposure in rats (olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, striatum).&nbsp; Using a mouse model of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (AD), it was also demonstrated that exposure led to an increased expression of microglial and astrocyte activation markers in the hippocampus and that effects persisted for two months post-exposure.&nbsp; In addition, there were marked elevations in amyloid b-42 protein and decreases in synaptophysin staining.&nbsp; Similar studies were done using concentrated ambient ultrafine particles.&nbsp; These studies showed that TNF gene expression was elevated in brain in response to inhaled ambient ultrafine particles and that such elevation was more pronounced in the transgenic AD mice as compared to non-transgenic mice.&nbsp; Furthermore, when TNF receptor bioactivity was blocked, microglial activation was dampened.&nbsp; Taken collectively, the findings from these studies suggest that inhaled particles can be transported to the central nervous system and that they can elicit tissue responses that could contribute to the progression of pathology in those regions where accumulation occurs.&nbsp; Given the growing literature that links ambient air pollution to oxidative stress, inflammation, neuronal loss, and behavioral and cognitive changes, it is critical to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which the changes occur, the specific components of pollutant mixtures that contribute to response, and strategies to mitigate adverse outcomes.

	This talk will describe the results of a multidisciplinary evaluation of associations of traffic-related air pollution to childhood autism risk. Because the neuropathological origins of autism likely occur in the prenatal and early postnatal period, an etiologic role is plausible, and findings from this study constitute evidence that inhaled toxins in traffic-related pollution may act on pathways that disrupt brain development and function to produce a clinically diagnosed behavioral disorder.

	The X-linked region known as the 'X-inactivation center' (Xic) was once dominated by protein-coding genes but, with the rise of Eutherian mammals some 150-200 million years ago, became infiltrated by genes that produce long noncoding RNA (lncRNA).&nbsp; Some of the noncoding genes have been shown to play crucial roles during X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), including the targeting of chromatin modifiers to the X. The rapid establishment of lncRNA hints at a possible preference for long transcripts in some aspects of epigenetic regulation.&nbsp; We will consider advantages lncRNA offers in delivering allelic, cis-limited, and locus-specific control.&nbsp; Examples include Xist, Tsix, and Jpx.&nbsp; The mechanisms by which they repress and activate gene expression will be discussed.

	MicroRNA (miRNA) gain- and loss-of-function can potently influence cellular behavior in normal physiologic states and in diseases such as cancer.&nbsp; The regulation of miRNA expression and activity by cellular signaling cascades can therefore result in dramatic phenotypic outputs.&nbsp; We previously demonstrated extensive control of miRNA expression by well-characterized oncogenic and tumor suppressor networks including the Myc, Kras, and p53 pathways.&nbsp; We are now employing novel mouse models with gain and loss of miRNA function to investigate the physiologic functions of the miRNAs embedded within these signaling pathways and the pathologic consequences when their functions are disrupted.&nbsp; Insights gained from these studies are revealing unanticipated roles for miRNAs <i>in vivo</i> and are informing our understanding of how dysregulated miRNA activity contributes to tumorigenesis. &nbsp;I will present our latest findings related to the regulation and function of mammalian miRNAs in normal physiology and in cancer and how these findings may be exploited for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

	The discovery of numerous noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts in species from yeast to mammals has dramatically altered our understanding of cell biology, especially the biology of diseases such as cancer. In humans, the identification of abundant long ncRNA (lncRNA) >200 bp has catalyzed their characterization as critical components of cancer biology. Recently, roles for lncRNAs as drivers of tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions have appeared in prevalent cancer types, such as breast and prostate cancer. In this review, we highlight the emerging impact of ncRNAs in cancer research, with a particular focus on the mechanisms and functions of lncRNAs.

	Establishment and maintenance of cell identity is shaped by a set of core regulatory factors with positive and negative influences on gene expression leading to the assembly of specialized chromatin structures.  Studies of non-coding RNAs have led to the proposal that non-coding RNAs may constitute such regulatory factors helping to balance the gene expression programs during development. We have uncovered a class of long non-coding RNAs with enhancer-like function, which positively regulate gene expression and chromatin architecture.

	While conversations about increasing diversity in graduate education, postdoctoral training, and the professoriate often focus on ability and efficacy, this presentation uses data from a nation-wide project to reframe this discourse, attending to additional factors which influence career decision making for scientists from underrepresented backgrounds.&nbsp; Specifically, using Social Cognitive Career Theory (Lent, Brown, &amp; Hackett, 1994, 2001) and the Social Influence Model (Estrada, Woodcock, Hernandez, &amp; Schultz, 2011) as guiding frameworks, we examine how performance measures, learning experiences, relationships with faculty, and individual values relate to interest in faculty careers amongst URM scientists. Data from a mixed methods study, integrating quantitative data collected from a diverse sample of 1900 biosciences Ph.D.s and interview data collected from a subset of these scientists, are presented to illustrate patterns in career decision-making.

	Historical approaches to training life scientists have been successful at creating a talented, creative, community of scientists, but have failed to produce meaningful improvement in participation of individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority (URM) groups. The absence of change likely is an unintended consequence of the fundamental culture and practices of research and training. The culture and practices can be well-modeled and interpreted drawing on several social science theories and models, including: <i>Communities of Practice; cultural capital</i>;<i> Social Cognitive Career Theory, </i>and <i>identity formation</i>. Using these frameworks, we are testing the hypothesis that a hybrid model employing sophisticated coaches to complement what scientific mentors typically provide can mitigate the unconscious processes that negatively impact professional advancement of young URM scientists.&nbsp;In this NIH-funded, randomized controlled trial called the <i>Academy for Future Science Faculty</i>, our coaching model is being tested with a diverse cohort of 100 beginning and 60 advanced PhD students from around the U.S. along with 16 scientist coaches. The <i>Academy</i> is sustained through annual professional development gatherings, virtual electronic coaching group meetings, and individual contacts among students and coaches. The great majority of <i>Academy</i> students report high value from participation. Impacts have been as great as reports that a few participants would have dropped out of their PhD programs had it not been for the guidance and support from the <i>Academy</i>. Overall, the most commonly expressed critical characteristic of the <i>Academy</i> is the creation of a &lsquo;safe space&rsquo; where students could openly discuss and get support around important issues without fear of judgment or evaluation as often occurs in their PhD programs and mentored research. They also highly value the systematic career development information and skills/tools provided by the <i>Academy</i> and individual Coaches.&nbsp; Although it is still early in the study, there is some evidence that underrepresented minorities and women perceive greater levels of benefit and positive influences on aspirations toward academic careers than other students. Data to allow meaningful comparison between <i>Academy</i> and Control groups are currently being gathered, but preliminary results suggest that while commitment to an academic career has declined among all participants, the decline is less steep among experimental participants than among control participants.

	Extreme weather and climate events can have serious impacts on human and ecological systems. Changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather associated with changes in the average climate are likely the most serious consequence of human induced global warming. Understanding what the future portends is vital if society hopes to adapt to a very different world.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The definition of &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; event is highly subjective. Some types of weather and climate events are extreme because of their rarity. Others types of events are extreme in the context of their impacts.&nbsp; As average temperatures continue to rise due to the human changes to the composition of the atmosphere, it is very likely that events we currently consider to be heat waves will occur more frequently and be more severe over the course of this century. In fact, events that are currently considered rare will likely become commonplace. For instance, daily temperatures currently expected to occur about once every twenty years are projected to be experienced as frequently as every other year over large portions of the continental United States by the end of the 21st century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to follow historical trends.&nbsp; Accurate simulation of precipitation presents a much more difficult problem to climate models than does temperature.&nbsp; &nbsp;

	The rate of global mean sea level rise (GMSLR) has accelerated during the last two centuries, from a rate of order tenths of mm yr-1 during the late Holocene, to about 1.7 mm yr-1 since 1901.&nbsp; Ocean thermal expansion and glacier melting were the dominant contributors to 20th century GMSLR, with relatively small contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Process-based models suggest that the larger rate of rise since 1990 results from increased radiative forcing (both natural and anthropogenic) and increased ice-sheet outflow, induced by warming of the immediately adjacent ocean.&nbsp; Confidence in projections of global mean sea level rise has increased since the AR4 because of improved physical process-based understanding of observed sea level change, especially in recent decades, and the inclusion of future rapid ice-sheet dynamical changes, for which a quantitative assessment could not be made on the basis of scientific knowledge available at the time of the AR4. By 2100, the rate of GMSLR for a scenario of high emissions (RCP8.5) could approach the average rates that occurred during the last deglaciation, whereas for a a strong emissions mitigation scenario (RCP2.6) it could stabilise at rates similar to those of the early 21st century. In either case, GMSLR will continue for many subsequent centuries.&nbsp; Although there has been much recent progress, projections of ice-sheet change are still uncertain, especially beyond 2100. Future sea level change will not be globally uniform, but models still exhibit substantial disagreement in projections of ice mass loss and ocean dynamics, which are the main influences on the pattern. Uncertainty in projections of future storminess is a further obstacle to confident projection of changes in sea level extremes.

	Terrestrial ecosystems have encountered substantial warming over the last century, with temperatures over land increasing about twice as rapidly as those over the oceans. Earth&rsquo;s land areas will likely warm dramatically over the 21<sup>st</sup> century, should emissions continue to grow at the high rates that have occurred in recent decades. &nbsp;The potential global warming is comparable in magnitude to the largest changes in the last 65 million years, but is one to several orders of magnitude more rapid. The rate of warming implies a velocity of climate change and required range shifts of up to several km/yr, raising the prospect of daunting challenges for ecosystems, especially in the context extensive land-use and degradation, changes in the frequency and severity of extreme events, and interactions with other stresses.

	Short-term and long-term research needs for mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change will be discussed based on the recent U.S. National Climate Assessment, the IPCC, and international efforts funded by the Global Environment Facility and the World Bank.&nbsp; Research in the realms of basic science, engineering, and social science are all needed.&nbsp; Near-term priorities in the mitigation arena include rapid deployment of existing technologies, and developing and readying a next generation of energy technologies &ndash; such as advanced renewables, and carbon capture and sequestration to be widely available in the next 2 decades.&nbsp; Adaptation is much more nascent than mitigation; activities to date have primarily focused on identifying vulnerabilities and potential coping actions, but little implementation, monitoring or evaluation of options has occurred.&nbsp; Actions that have been taken to date tend to be incremental.&nbsp; &lsquo;Best practices&rsquo; or lessons learned from adaptation experiments need to be aggregated across sectors and scales.&nbsp; For the most part, local practitioner experiences are not being captured and integrated into the peer-reviewed literature. Methods for tackling multiple stresses occurring in concert with climate change, such as habitat fragmentation, pollution, invasive species, and biodiversity loss, need to be developed.&nbsp; Approaches to evaluate the &lsquo;success&rsquo; of adaptation actions and to determine when &lsquo;transformational&rsquo; adaptation may be needed require development.

	This presentation will report the results of <i>Stemming the Tide</i>, a study that investigated factors that contribute to women&rsquo;s decisions to stay or leave engineering careers.&nbsp; Women are underrepresented in the field of engineering at every level. Most of the research on effective interventions has focused on increasing women&rsquo;s choice of engineering major. However, though women are now 20% of engineering graduates only 11% of professional engineers are women (National Science Foundation, 2003). In fact, the proportion of women engineers has declined slightly in the past decade, suggesting that, while the pool of qualified women engineering graduates has increased, they are not staying in the field of engineering. Over 5500 women responded to our study.&nbsp; We will present our key findings on differences between women who stayed in engineering and those who left the field.&nbsp; For example, we found that nearly half of women left a career in engineering because of working conditions, too much travel, lack of advancement, or low salary.&nbsp; One-in-three women left engineering because they did not like the climate, their boss, or the culture. &nbsp;One-in-four left engineering to spend time with family.&nbsp; Women who left engineering were not different from those who stayed in the field in their interests, confidence in their abilities, or the positive outcomes they expected from performing engineering related tasks. &nbsp;We also found that women&rsquo;s decisions to stay in engineering are best predicted by a combination of psychological factors and factors related to the organizational climate, including key supportive people in the organization, such as supervisors and co-workers, and companies that valued and recognized their contributions and invested substantially in their training and professional development, expressed greatest levels of satisfaction with their jobs and careers.&nbsp; Women who wanted to leave their companies were also very likely to leave the field of engineering altogether.

	Photon radiations such as X- and gamma-rays have been used effectively to treat cancer for many years although their use can be limited by damage to normal tissues in the path of the photon beams. Charged particle therapy is a rapidly emerging technique in radiotherapy because the exquisite dose localization of charged particles allows for higher doses to be given to tumor tissue while normal tissues are exposed to lower doses and decreased volumes of normal tissues are irradiated. To date, most particle therapy has employed energetic proton beams where the characteristics of the Bragg curve allow for dose distributions that are as good as or better than even the most advanced X-ray therapy approaches. Heavy ions can have even better dose distributions in the target because of reduced lateral scattering compared with protons. However, the substantial potential clinical advantages of heavier charged particles, such as carbon ions, lie in the additional biological effects of the particles which include greater cell killing effectiveness, decreased radiation resistance of hypoxic cells in tumors and reduced cell cycle dependence of radiation response. These biological advantages depend on many factors such as endpoint, cell or tissue type, dose, dose rate or fractionation, charged particle type and energy, and oxygen concentration. This talk will discuss the unique biological advantages of charged particle therapy and how the advantages can be further exploited by dose scheduling and combinations with molecularly-targeted agents to increase efficacy of particle therapy for cancer. In addition, areas of particular research needs, such as quantification of Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) for various tumor types and radiation qualities, role of genetic background of tumor cells, sensitivity of cancer stem cells to particles, and carcinogenic potential of charged particle therapy, will be highlighted.

	The susceptibility of individuals at the extremes of the population age-distribution (the very young and the very old) and differences between sexes are often not adequately assessed. By understanding the genes expressed in each sex at the various life stages, the assessment of health risk versus benefit can be more rationally determined. &nbsp;Comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome, including miRNA, and the epigenome in the liver and kidney of Fisher 344 rats from 2 weeks to 2 years of age reveals substantial differences at various life-stages and between the sexes. &nbsp;In the liver and kidney, the expression of nearly 4000 genes was found to significantly vary with age and/or sex.&nbsp; Many of these genes are involved in xenobiotic metabolism and transport, processes that impact drug efficacy and safety.&nbsp; The expression of genes that code for some of the kidney injury protein biomarkers recently qualified by the FDA were found to vary substantially with age and sex, in some cases up to 100-fold.&nbsp; Such dramatic differences may impact the interpretation of biomarker results. Examination of miRNA expression in the liver showed nearly 200 miRNAs varied with age and/or sex.&nbsp; Notably, a group of 42 miRNAs was expressed at a relatively high level at 2 weeks of age in both sexes followed by low or no detectable expression at older ages. However, this 2 week-specific miRNA expression was not evident in the kidney. &nbsp;Analysis of potential target mRNAs for liver miRNAs suggests roles in disease susceptibility involving fibrosis as well as regulation of xenobiotic metabolism related genes. A similar number of kidney miRNAs also displayed sex and age-related changes which may be linked to gene regulation. These differences may be related to age- and sex-specific susceptibilities to adverse drug reactions or disease states. Understanding these differences should improve personalized medicine both in terms of disease prevention and management, and safer use of drugs.

	Children are more susceptible to exposures to environmental toxicants than adults, and <i>in utero</i> exposures may result in developmental problems and chronic diseases. Some children can be particularly vulnerable due to their genetic makeup which can affect their bodies&rsquo; abilities to detoxify pesticides and other environmental chemicals.&nbsp; Epigenetic changes, particularly DNA methylation, play a significant role in the mediation of the effects of environmental exposure on human health and are hypothesized to be major contributing factors to the early-life origins of adult disease.&nbsp; Results from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) birth cohort study will be presented to illustrate complex relationships of the effects of prenatal exposure to pesticides and other environmental toxicants with genetic and epigenetic factors on children&rsquo;s health. &nbsp;The CHAMACOS longitudinal birth cohort study (N=601) investigates exposure to pesticides in low-income Mexican-American farmworker families; mothers and their children were followed from early pregnancy to 9 years of age. We have previously found that trans-placental exposures to several of these pollutants are associated with adverse birth outcomes including shorter gestational duration as well as abnormal reflexes in children at different ages, higher risk of attention disorders, and decreased IQ at age 7.&nbsp; Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), which can detoxify OPs, provides an example of a metabolic enzyme whose broad variability within populations may confer differential susceptibility to environmental exposures.&nbsp; Someone with low PON1 levels may be less protected from OP exposures than people with higher PON1 levels. We determined PON1 genotypes and three PON1 enzyme activities in more than 450 mothers and their children from pregnancy through age 9 and found that both age and genetics were strong determinants of PON1 variability and thus susceptibility to pesticides.&nbsp; We also used cutting edge technology including lllumina 450K BeadChip arrays and pyrosequencing to investigate global and site-specific DNA methylation in CHAMACOS children.&nbsp; Unlike genetics, epigenetic mechanisms can be reversible and an enhanced understanding of their role may lead to better protection of pregnant women and children, and improved public health.

	Selenium is an essential trace element for humans and is referred to as the &ldquo;essential poison&rdquo; because it is needed at very low levels, about 50 micrograms per day, while only slightly elevated levels, 800 micrograms per day, are toxic. Selenium replaces sulfur in some rare instances in the form of selenocysteine, the 21<sup>st</sup> amino acid in the genetic code. The complexity of the selenocysteine-insertion machinery at the ribosome suggests that selenium performs some chemistry that sulfur cannot. &nbsp;Here, I attempt to answer the question &ldquo;Why Nature chose selenium?&rdquo; by connecting its chemical properties with its importance to biology. Selenium is a Janus-faced element because it is a good donor of electrons and a good acceptor of electrons. Both of these properties can explain its use in biology. Selenium is a good antioxidant because it quickly reacts with reactive oxygen species to form selenium-oxides. These selenium-oxides are highly electrophilic. The selenium atom of the oxide then accepts electrons from a donor to become reduced. The chemistry-biology connection for selenium is that it confers enzymes with the ability to resist inactivation by oxidation.

It was noted that are always significant delays between onset of the situation, identification of research needs and commencement of research, to the detriment of obtaining effective research outcomes. These delays include setting up calls for applications and awarding of grants through to regulatory and ethics approval processes. In considering how to minimize delays between emergence of major disease threats and the commencement of essential research activities, NHMRC has been exploring mechanisms for having research &lsquo;ready to go&rsquo;, including agreed protocols, active participation in international networks, and a capacity to undertake research during &lsquo;regular; disease outbreaks (seasonal influenza).

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Depletion of soil fertility constitutes one of the most important constraints to sustainable agricultural production, causing low per capita food production in Africa. Inappropriate soil fertility management, further increases loss of productivity of resource-poor farmers and affects their food security and livelihood. Large areas of most sub-Saharan African soils have low inherent fertility and do not receive adequate nutrient replenishment. Preserving soil fertility and enhancing productivity through appropriate soil management and conservation can play a major role in achieving farm household food security and agricultural development. This paper explores conceptual approaches to increasing food security and poverty alleviation in Africa through the replenishment of soil fertility as an investment in natural resource capital,<i> </i>and to outline the elements of strategies for its implementation. It highlights some successful experiences in the region, constraints and possible solutions specific to the major agro-ecological zones and the importance of holistic and participatory approaches for soil productivity improvement. Some specific aspects are concerned with Implementing development projects to scale-up fertility replenishment practices, Developing projects focusing on key bottlenecks such as the access to rock phosphate and the awareness and knowledge of the technology components, Developing policies that reduce the disparity between world market and the prices paid by African farmers for mineral fertilizers, Investing in community-based development projects that integrate the agriculture, education, and health sectors.

	In recent years the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through histone modifications has come to light as an important mechanism of transcriptional control. Transcriptional dysregulation is a key feature in Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by problems with movement, cognition, and behavioral functioning. Previous work from our group has demonstrated that post-translational modifications of histone proteins are altered in multiple cellular and animal models of HD. Specifically acetylated histone H3 association with the promoters of downregulated genes is decreased in the presence of mutant huntingtin. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization (ChIP-on-chip) indicated that there is a significant decrease in the levels of acetylated histone H3 at gene loci in a transgenic mouse model of HD. More importantly, treatment of cellular and animal models of HD with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors reversed the decrease in acetylated histone binding to gene promoters and normalized mRNA levels for the downregulated genes. Together, our findings demonstrate that histone acetylation is altered in HD and provides evidence for the role for HDAC inhibitors as potential novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Our current efforts are aimed at identifying novel HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of HD.

	Weakly electric knifefish have intrigued both biologists and engineers for decades with their unique ability to sense with a self-generated electric field and capacity for multi-directional swimming. Study of these fish has resulted in bio-inspired robots that illuminate the principles behind their electrosensory system and unique swimming abilities. These robots have uncovered the mechanisms by which knifefish generate thrust for swimming forward and backward, hovering, and moving vertically with an elongated fin along their belly. Robotic active electrosense enables sensing in murky waters where other sensing modalities fail. Artificial electrosense is capable of aiding navigation, detection and discrimination of objects, and mapping the environment, all tasks for which the fish use electrosense extensively. While robotic ribbon fin and artificial electrosense research has been pursued separately to reduce complications that arise when they are combined, electric fish have succeeded in their ecological niche through close coupling of their sensing and mechanical systems. Future integration of electrosense and ribbon fin technology into a knifefish robot should likewise result in a vehicle capable of navigating complex 3D geometries unreachable with current underwater vehicles, as well as provide insights into how to design mobile robots that integrate high bandwidth sensing with highly responsive multidirectional movement.

	In 2005 the Lake Malawi Drilling Project collected a series of long drill cores from L. Malawi, one of the largest and oldest of the African rift lakes.&nbsp; The longest of these cores penetrated to ~381 meters below the lake floor, and provides a record of the lake and its watershed over the last ~1.3 million years. The core records demonstrate an extraordinarily dynamic lake system, which has fluctuated between vastly different limnological states during the Quaternary. During extremely arid periods, when precipitation in the watershed fell to 25-35% of modern values, this currently large (~29000km<sup>2</sup>) and very deep (706m) lake was reduced to ~5% of its current area and ~100m depth. Climatic and limnologic fluctuations of this magnitude have occurred repeatedly over the lake&rsquo;s long history, most recently during the megadrought episodes of the early Late Pleistocene (~100,000 years ago). Variability in climatic conditions in the Malawi basin is linked to orbital (Milankovitch) cyclicity, on a variety of scales, although noncyclic (e.g. tectonic) processes have also strongly influenced the lake&rsquo;s history by changing watershed and lake basin shape and depth characteristics.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Dramatic changes in Lake Malawi&rsquo;s ecological history are associated with the major lake level fluctuations. Today, and for the past ~60-70 thousand years, L. Malawi has been a strongly stratified lake, with very clear waters and low nutrient concentrations in surface waters intersecting the steeply sloping (fault bounded) rocky lake floors that ring the basin. These conditions have been conducive to the evolution of an ecosystem dependent on visual cues for mate recognition and predation, especially among the hyperdiverse cichlid fish that dominate the nearshore environment today. During the many megadrought episodes of the lake&rsquo;s history however, nearshore and offshore ecological conditions would have been very different. The lake would have been reduced to an extent that the rocky habitats associated with major border faults would have no longer ringed the lakeshore (muddy bottoms would have prevailed along most coasts). The much smaller lake would have been well-mixed and turbid with algae in surface waters (e.g. a green lake, rather than a blue one). The combination of these factors would have severely impacted cichlid communities and other components of the nearshore ecosystem, and probably contributed to a significant loss of biodiversity during these times. Lake Malawi&rsquo;s evolutionary history as a hotspot of biodiversity must be understood within the framework of this dramatic history, especially in comparison to its sister Lake Tanganyika, where the impact of climatically driven lake level fluctuations was most likely much less dramatic. The rapidity of ecological change evident in parts of the paleoecological record of Lake Malawi also gives us pause to reflect on how quickly anthropogenically driven changes in lake level (for example from water diversion from agriculture) or nutrient inputs might also impact this extraordinary ecosystem.

	More than one and a half centuries after the publication of Charles R. Darwin&rsquo;s <i>The Origin of Species</i>, the identification of the processes governing the emergence of novel species remains a fundamental question to biology. Why is it that some groups have diversified in a seemingly explosive manner, while other lineages have remained unvaried over millions of years? What are the external factors and environmental conditions that promote diversification? And what is the molecular basis of adaptation, evolutionary innovation and diversification? A key to these and related questions is the comparative study of exceptionally diverse yet relatively young species assemblages that have radiated in geographically well-defined areas, such as the Darwin&rsquo;s finches on the Galapagos archipelago, the Caribbean <i>Anoles</i> lizards or the cichlid fishes in the Great Lakes of East Africa. Lakes Tanganyika, Malawi, and Victoria are each teeming with a unique set of hundreds of endemic cichlid species, which have evolved in the last few millions to several thousands of years only. East Africa&rsquo;s cichlid species differ greatly in ecologically relevant, hence naturally selected, characters such as mouth morphology and body shape, but also in sexually selected traits such as coloration. One of the most fascinating aspects of cichlid evolution is the frequent occurrence of evolutionary parallelisms between and even within lakes as consequence of the independent adaptation to the same ecological niches.

	At many points within a woman&rsquo;s reproductive span, it is more normal to have variable menstrual cycles than regular ones. Yet we pathologize women who stray too far from the 28-day norm, naming and medicalizing these states rather than understanding them in the context of age, reproductive state and environment. Psychosocial stress, energy availability and immune challenges are environmental factors that particularly influence cycles across the reproductive span, from ovarian hormones and follicular dynamics, to the lining of the uterus. These effects are largely reversible when these challenges diminish, providing yet more evidence that modulation of the menstrual cycle is functional and adaptive. Numerous lines of research have unequivocally demonstrated that when subject to ecological constraint, the first components of ovarian function to experience suppression are in the luteal phase. Yet the proximate mechanisms that underlie variation in conception, implantation, and thus pregnancy rates, all of which require an understanding of luteal reproductive function, are under-described. Emergent themes in the evolutionary study of women&rsquo;s reproductive function allow us to explain and promote additional research on the functional modulation of menstrual cycles. This in turn makes it possible to examine unique aspects of human conception, implantation and pregnancy, and more carefully bound definitions of pathology. Examining environmental effects via an inflammatory mechanism offer a new way to understand variation in ovarian hormones, follicular dynamics, and endometrial function.

My particular focus will be on bridging a female primate&rsquo;s experience in utero and the in utero experience she provides her developing daughter in a &ldquo;Womb to Womb&rdquo; framework of developmental programming. &nbsp;This discussion is based on my work in two primate species: common marmoset monkeys and humans.

	Milk is abundant at our local grocery store in the form of dairy products and infant formulas. This ubiquity of standardized milk in our modern environment has the potential for the general public, and even researchers, to think of milk one dimensionally. Milk is not just food though, milk is also medicine and signal. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of other &ldquo;bioactives&rdquo; are present in mother&rsquo;s milk. Importantly, milk is not uniform across mothers or within a single mother across time. Maternal health, nutrition, culture, reproductive history, early-life conditions, and genes all contribute to differences in milk composition. Less understood are the consequences of that variation for infant development and fitness outcomes. Here I will present emerging research that addresses the magnitude, sources, and consequences of inter-individual variation of bioactive constituents in milk in the rhesus monkey. Long-term research at the Comparative Lactation Lab and the California National Primate Research Center has produced &gt;1000 milk samples from hundreds of rhesus macaque mothers (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) since 2005. Fats, proteins, sugars, minerals, hormones, bacteria, and other constituents in mother&rsquo;s milk are highly variable and often differ between milk produced for sons and daughters. Milk exerts important influences on infant behavior, growth, and development and through those effects has consequences for transitions to adulthood and initiation of the reproductive career. Better understanding of variation in milk composition, especially for milk constituents linked to infant cognition, neurodevelopment, behavior, and metabolism, enhances an evolutionary biological perspective of parent-offspring dynamics. Moreover, biological and social scientific research on this topic can be directly translated into more personalized clinical recommendations and health optimization for mothers and their infants. Such research also highlights the importance of establishing infrastructure and institutional support for breastfeeding promotion and facilitation. Lastly, and quite importantly, a better understanding of the composition and function of milk informs the manufacture of more representative infant formulas. Milk matters.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Early psychosocial experiences exert a potent effect on lifelong socio-emotional well-being and health in humans and non-human primates, but the neurogenomic mechanisms are only recently emerging. Dynamic reorganization of stress pathway gene expression patterns has been documented across species following many types of early life experiences. We know that these changes may contribute to healthy and pathological socio-emotional behavior. We know less about how these changes are maintained across the lifespan. The epigenetic landscape in neural stress pathway structures and genes may play a role in some of the long-term neurobehavioral effects of early stress. I will discuss the relationships among early stress, the neural epigenetic landscape, and behavioral development in a non-human primate, the rhesus macaque. This area of research has evolutionary as well as biomedical implications. Unraveling pathways of inheritance and development will help us understand their effects at the individual and potentially even evolutionary levels. This area of research further engenders optimism that, while the epigenetic landscape may put some children at risk for poor health outcomes, it may also be one key to interventions that improve the socio-emotional well-being of at-risk children and their families.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Studies in human reproduction consistently find that survival in infancy and early childhood is largely dependent upon the presence of reliable and highly invested caretakers. More often than not, these caretakers consist of biologically related kin. However, it is widely accepted that humans create and maintain families in a multitude of ways. Although humans have the cognitive ability and social complexity to modify the enactment of these familial forms, all kin and caretakers are not equally able to invest in dependent offspring. In this presentation, I will discuss the diversity of familial forms in the Caribbean, and my research on parental and alloparental investment, institutional care settings and child health outcomes in Jamaica. Specifically, this study examines the growth and development of children living in state-sponsored residential childcare facilities as compared to their age and gender matched peers who are living with their biological family members. Ethnographic, anthropometric, and biometric data were collected from children living throughout the central mountainous region of the Jamaica. Investment received by these children varies considerably in different care settings. This variability in received care correlates to differential health outcomes. This research explores whether institutional care settings simulate parental investment behaviors, and whether living with biological kin is consistently more beneficial to the growth and development of young children. It also examines how cultural variability in parenting styles may correlate to different forms of investment. By investigating the setting and the contexts of care for these children, we gain broader insights into the various pathways by which children obtain access to essential psychosocial and material resources essential to their successful navigation of this important developmental period. <span>&nbsp;Most critically, we also learn what happens when these avenues of investment are unavailable. </span>

	As fishery catches have plateaued in recent years, aquaculture and stock enhancement programs are increasingly viewed as essential to meet global demand for protein.&nbsp; However, empirical evidence is accumulating to demonstrate that 1) long-term sustainability of living aquatic resources depends on conservation of a diverse portfolio of naturally-reproducing populations, and 2) genetic interactions with domesticated individuals reduces the diversity and fitness of natural populations.&nbsp; Two general strategies are possible to minimize adverse fitness consequences of unintentional (but not completely avoidable) genetic interactions between cultured and wild populations:&nbsp; keep the cultured populations as genetically SIMILAR as possible to wild populations, or make them as DIFFERENT as possible.&nbsp; For the first time, we quantitatively evaluated the inherent tradeoffs in the SIMILAR and DIFFERENT strategies, using a coupled quantitative genetics/population dynamics model.&nbsp; Important findings include the following:&nbsp; 1) Although either strategy can in theory produce minimal fitness effects, in practice biological and logistical constraints will make it difficult to achieve extreme forms of either strategy.&nbsp; The worst-case scenario, which occurs when the cultured population is genetically divergent but not different enough to prevent interbreeding, is not unrealistic for many practical situations.&nbsp; 2) The DIFFERENT strategy is a feasible alternative only if an opportunity for strong purifying selection occurs before escapees have a chance to reproduce.&nbsp; 3) Fitness effects of cultured individuals are larger if the cultured-wild interactions occur before density-dependent mortality in the wild.&nbsp; 4) Persistent, low-level leakage from aquaculture operations lead to at least as large fitness consequences as do the same number of individuals escaping in a large pulse.&nbsp; 5) Sterilization of cultured individuals is potentially a very effective strategy to reduce adverse fitness consequences for some species.

	It is well recognised that fisheries resources are a major contributor to human well-being across the globe, providing a range of social and economic benefits. Moreover, exploited species typically comprise important components of aquatic ecosystems across trophic levels, and thus underpin aspects of ecosystem diversity and function.&nbsp; In addition to the challenges associated with generating the science of sustainability, is the significant issue of implementing and enforcing a legislative framework that maximises yield within conservation limits. Many marine fisheries are essentially trans-boundary, straddling numerous nations where biological units rarely correspond to management units. Correspondingly, there exists a mosaic of stocks differentiated to varying degrees, often exhibiting contrasting trajectories of response to harvesting and ensuing resilience to environmental change. While socio-economic and political constraints confound attempts to harmonise management of such resources, there is additionally the need to develop rigorous enforcement of policy. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing represents the single largest continuing threat to fisheries sustainability in our oceans, with an estimated 25% of all landings globally falling under the IUU banner. While several monitoring, control and surveillance methods are available, collectively they fail to detect or deter most infringements. New tools and their wide-scale deployment are therefore required. Genetics and genomics provide not only a wealth of potential tools that can determine traceability at species and population or regional levels, they also importantly have characteristics that are amenable to forensic validation. Detection is only one part of the enforcement process: additionally, sound, robust evidence must be gathered to support prosecutions in a court of law. Here, I will consider criteria needed for forensic validation of tools, akin to those used in human forensics, together with an outline of recent tools available and their application. While various illustrative examples will be used to demonstrate utility of fisheries forensics using DNA-based tools, there will be a particular focus on outputs from a recent European consortium, <em>FishPopTrace,</em> the most comprehensive to date. Remaining challenges and opportunities will be reviewed within the context of IUU and eco-certification of fish and fisheries products.

	While moving towards sustainable and profitable fishery is a global goal that is high on the international policy agenda, designing appropriate fishery management strategies and policy frameworks remains challenging. The natural resource of wild fish is not easily accessible to assessment of abundance or exploitation impact, and is also often subject to political quarrels or stakeholder debates.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">It is generally acknowledged that independent scientific advice is indispensable to meet this challenge and to support sound fishery and aquaculture management and policy development. This is also reflected in legal provisions and policy frameworks such as the US Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the South Australian Fishery Management Act, and the European Union (EU) Common Fisheries Policy.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Additionally the importance of data availability to fishery scientists is largely recognized and in some parts of the world fishery data collection for research and scientific advice is legally endorsed. An example is the Data Collection Framework, obliging EU member states to collect and provide fishery and aquaculture related, biological, technical and economic data.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">However genetic data and information is not yet routinely taken into account for data collection frameworks, or the design of fishery management strategies, and even rarer are examples where genetics are used in combination with traditional fishery data to feed into management approaches.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">This is surprising: fishery genetics has a long history spanning more than fifty years, genetic and genomic analytical approaches progress very quickly, recently the publication of peer-reviewed articles on fishery genetics has risen swiftly. And yet fishery genetics mostly prevails in a parallel world instead of being integrated into management strategy frameworks.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Claiming that genetic analysis can provide a valuable asset to the swiftly changing and increasingly complex realm of fishery management and policy making, and by using examples from different parts of the world, this presentation will discuss reasons for its hesitant uptake into fishery management, including a view on costs and benefits in a fishery control context. Based on these observations it will be suggested how stronger collaboration between relevant stakeholders could be created, ultimately leading to a coherent integration of genetics into fishery management, to tackle conventional management challenges along with those associated with a shift towards an ecosystem based approach to fishery management.

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Benzene is an established cause of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and may cause one or more lymphoid malignancies in humans. Occupational exposure to benzene, even at levels below the current U.S. occupational standard of 1 ppm, causes hematotoxicity. Toxicogenomics (e.g. genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics) and systems biology (study of the interactions among toxicogenomic endpoints using bioinformatics) approaches in human populations, animals, and <i>in vitro</i>models, exposed to a range of benzene levels, are key to understanding gene-environment interactions in benzene toxicity and can identify biomarkers of exposure, early effect and susceptibility. Through analysis of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomes of 125 workers exposed to a wide range of benzene levels, we recently reported highly significant widespread perturbation of gene expression at all exposure levels, as well as alterations in acute myeloid leukemia and immune response pathways. Sequencing of the PBMC transcriptomes from a subset of the study subjects revealed additional alterations in gene expression. From preliminary epigenomic data in the human subjects, we have identified benzene-induced alterations in the DNA methylome and miRNome. Using genomic screens in yeast and human screening systems, with subsequent confirmation in human cells, we have identified potential biomarkers of susceptibility. We are developing bioinformatic methods to integrate these and future toxicogenomic datasets, in a systems biology approach, to further understand pathways of benzene toxicity and to reveal potential biomarkers associated with a range of exposures.

	Genetic background has an important role in susceptibility to complex lung diseases, and the genetic contribution to disease phenotypes varies between populations. Interaction between genetic background and exposures to environmental stimuli, and understanding the mechanisms through which environmental exposure interact with susceptibility genes, are critical to disease prevention. Inbred mouse models provide important insight to understand human disease etiologies because genetic background and environmental exposures can be controlled. Tools including <i>in silico</i> haplotyping, collaborative cross and diversity outcross mouse panels, bioinformatic applications, and -omics technologies have enhanced our ability to identify disease genes and pathways to guide translational investigations to human populations. Combined genetic and genomic approaches have yielded important insight to mechanisms of susceptibility to many complex traits and diseases. We have integrated inbred mouse and cell-based models with haplotype association mapping (genetic), global gene expression analyses (genomic), and expression quantitative trait locus mapping (eQTL or genetical genomics) to identify candidate susceptibility genes and associated gene networks important in toxicant-induced lung injury. The overarching goal of these investigations is to determine whether human homologues of these susceptibility genes associate with disease risk in human populations. Efforts to identify and validate susceptibility genes in mouse models of environmental disease with a goal towards translational application have enabled identification of individuals who are susceptible to disease. For example, epidemiological and clinical investigations have associated functional polymorphisms in human <i>NRF2</i> (NF-E2 related factor 2) and <i>TNF</i> (tumor necrosis factor alpha) with susceptibility to acute lung injury and ozone-induced changes in lung function, respectively. Importantly, these discoveries may also lead to novel intervention or therapeutic strategies to prevent disease.

	Environmental exposures during early development and other critical life stages may induce changes to the epigenome resulting in potentially deleterious phenotypic effects including metabolic disease, cancer, and neurological disorders. The field of epigenetics is experiencing a rapid advancement in technology, methodology, and data acquisition that now allows for the identification of the constellation of genomic loci with altered epigenetic status following dose-dependent exposures. Thus, epigenomic profiling facilitates the identification of biomarkers of exposure, enabling clinicians to identify at-risk individuals prior to disease onset. Utilizing a multi-pronged approach with an <i>in vivo</i> mouse model, human clinical samples, and an ongoing 15-year longitudinal epidemiological study, the overall goal of this presentation is to elucidate the impact of perinatal bisphenol A (BPA) and lead (Pb) exposure on metabolic homeostasis and DNA methylation, and the interplay between the two. Developmental exposure to environmentally relevant levels of BPA has been shown to affect both global and gene-specific DNA methylation patterns in rodents. We now draw upon data from multiple whole-epigenome platforms to show that multiple dose levels of BPA affect DNA methylation in mice and humans and that these epigenetic effects are non-monotonic in dose response. Preliminary studies also indicate that Pb exhibits epigenetic effects that may contribute to its known neurotoxic and obesogenic activities.

Climate change is a key environmental issue with major concerns in respect of the increase in global temperature and concomitant direct and indirect impacts. Air quality and climate are often treated as separate science and policy areas. Air quality encompasses the here-and-now of pollutant emissions, atmospheric transformations and their direct effect on human and ecosystem health. Climate change deals with the drivers leading to a warmer world and the consequences of that. These two science and policy issues are inexorably linked via common pollutants, such as ozone (methane) and black carbon.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The talk will look at the new scientific evidence around so-called &ldquo;short-lived climate forcers&rdquo; and the growing realisation that a way to meet short-term climate change targets may be through the control of &ldquo;air quality&rdquo; pollutants. It will be shown that there is a range of decision space when a holistic approach that considers the linkages between air quality and climate is applied. While there are beneficial solutions to mitigation of both issues, other options include those that could be detrimental to one or both. For these reasons it is important to consider not only the scientific co-benefits and trade-offs (disadvantages) of possible policy measures, but to also consider them in an economic, political and social context

	Composed of about 10 trillion cells, the human body is host to 100 trillion bacteria which constitute an extremely rich and diverse flora. From a genetic point of view there is 500,000 bacterial genes on average compared to 23,000 genes in the human genome. Indeed, a human being is the result of a mutualistic association, stemming from a co-evolution, whom balance is essential to maintaining the health and well-being. The intestinal flora is now seen as a full organ linking (external) environmental factors and biology of the organism (the host). It provides essential functions throughout life. An imbalance of the intestinal flora or dysbiosis has been demonstrated in a variety of human diseases, whether metabolic, cardiovascular or immuno-inflammatory. These observations have been made in particular through the development, in recent years, of tools for the study of the metagenome allowing the sequencing of bacterial genes from the gut microbiome. A factor very frequently found is the loss of bacterial diversity. Although the loss of diversity is typically associated with taking antibiotics, it is also found in other diseases such as cystic fibrosis, intestinal disorders, and more recently in metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Recently, our team has helped to show that obese people with a loss of bacterial diversity had more risk factors (dyslipidemia, low-grade inflammation) and improved less these risk factors with a restrictive but rich in fibers diet. This presentation will review the recent discoveries in the field by taking the example of metabolic diseases.

	The presentation will call for partnerships to be improved and redefined since power relationships within a partnership are often unbalanced – for example, between the North and the South. If partnerships are weak and unbalanced they will not achieve their goals. Therefore, it is time for African governments to stop being passive partners; they should participate actively. African governments should also ensure partnership between their own health, research and finance ministries. Also companies operating in Africa must be made to contribute towards the costs of medical research. The presentation will also address the importance of developing the capacity of Africa’s centres of excellence, the need to involve social scientists in clinical research, and the need to monitor the translation of research findings into policy and benefits for populations.

	High-altitude native populations, exposed to the lifelong stress of low barometric pressure and partial pressure of inspired oxygen, represent natural experiments in evolution and adaptation.&nbsp; Fieldwork on the major high-altitude plateaus discovered that Andean, Tibetan, and Ethiopian Amhara highlanders differ from their lowland counterparts in ways that appear to offset the unavoidable stress of hypoxia.&nbsp; Unexpectedly, the three highland populations also differ among themselves.&nbsp; For example, Andean highlanders have persistently elevated hemoglobin concentration levels, while Tibetan and Ethiopian Amhara do not.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tibetan trait of relatively low-hemoglobin concentration associates, in multiple studies, with single nucleotide polymorphism sites in an oxygen sensor (<i>EGLN1</i>) and an oxygen homeostasis transcription factor (<i>EPAS1</i>) gene. &nbsp;In contrast, the Ethiopian Amhara trait of relatively low-hemoglobin concentration associates, in one study, with one SNP.&nbsp; The genetic basis of the Andean response of elevated hemoglobin concentration is unknown, although the trait reverses when Andean highlanders migrate to low altitudes, suggesting that for some reason this population has acclimatized while the other two have undergone natural selection.&nbsp; &nbsp;Discovering the explanation for the three different microevolutionary patterns offers insight into ongoing evolutionary processes.&nbsp; Identification of relevant genes paradoxically leads to considering other environmental factors that may influence their expression in these three populations. &nbsp;The different phenotypes and involved pathways have implications for vulnerability to disease and have the potential to point the way to new therapies for hypoxic patients at all altitudes.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The impact of global socio-economic forces on current population biology and health among Samoans has produced very high body mass index (BMI), adiposity and cardiometabolic risk&nbsp; levels over time. These are associated with individual and ecological measures of modernization. In particular, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and lipid and lipoprotein risk levels are at extremely high levels throughout the Samoan archipelago, and among Samoans and other Polynesians in the US and other high income nations to which they emigrated in the last 40 years.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The presentation will emphasize the integration of evolutionary, demographic and historical forces with contemporary nutritional exposures, genetic and epigenetic influences, culturally patterned behaviors, and world economic forces as a way to understand the high levels of non-communicable disease in Samoans. This approach may also allow for efficacious and sustainable interventions.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Globally obesity is rising rapidly with each generation more overweight than the last, suggesting that the Samoan pattern of obesity, once remarkable and uncommon, may become more common. Thus, this relatively isolated and rapidly modernizing population can stand as an excellent model for environmental and genetic forces driving global obesity and non-communicable disease risk trends. Earlier results documented the rise in NCD risk factors with economic development and individual dietary intake and physical activity pattern across sex and age groups. Recent work showed how global and Pacific political-economic forces influence food availabilities and prices.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The unique population history of the Samoas has led to evolutionary scenarios about the forces of genetic drift and natural selection on key reproductive success traits related to energy storage, availability and metabolic use. This led us to search for the biologically-based susceptibilities underlying the body fatness and NCD risk factors. We identified familial aggregation and associations with genetic variation for NCD traits and also found gene-by-environment interactions. We do not have any solid evidence for any special unique genetic variants that predispose Samoans to obesity.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Two new research directions may also contribute interdisciplinary answers to questions about NCDs in Samoans, We are conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of with quality dietary and physical activity data. New studies on maternal, pregnancy and early life factors on child health are also underway, including establishing a Samoan birth cohort focused on fetal growth rates in relation to maternal factors and gestational exposures and &nbsp;how fetal growth rate variations influence postnatal growth rates in this overweight population. This lifespan developmental approach emphasizing fetal and early life influences and adaptive mechanisms along with the broader temporal perspectives about changes in ways of life should will yield novel findings and interpretations about Samoan health and human biology.

	Ages at menopause and symptom experiences at midlife differ within and across populations.&nbsp; These differences may explain some of the global variation in chronic health concerns.&nbsp; In this talk, three studies are detailed in which median ages at menopause were computed for diverse populations.&nbsp; Menstrual histories were collected in the same way, and identical methods of analyses resulted in median ages at menopause that span five years: 48.1 years among Bangladeshis living in Sylhet, Bangladesh; 49.2 years among Bangladeshi immigrants living in London; 49.6 years in Puebla, Mexico; 52.8 years among British women of European descent living in London; and 53.0 years in Hilo, Hawaii, regardless of ethnicity.&nbsp; Within populations, determinants of an earlier age at menopause included smoking, lower levels of education, fewer children, rural birthplace, more infectious diseases during childhood, and being unmarried.&nbsp; Some determinants were common across studies (e.g., level of education), others were specific to a particular context (e.g., infectious diseases during childhood).&nbsp; A comparative approach is also applied to examine symptom frequencies at midlife in relation to diverse climates, diets, reproductive histories, health-related behaviors, and cultures that influence the degree to which symptoms are noticed, labeled, and appropriate to report.&nbsp; For example, in Hilo, Hawaii, Japanese-American women reported fewer hot flashes but objectively demonstrated the same number of hot flashes as their European-American neighbors.&nbsp; This presentation addresses variation in age at menopause, the measurement and interpretation of variation in symptom experience among women at midlife, and potential health consequences.<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Funding:&nbsp; NSF No. BCS-1156368 (with L.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Recent research has implicated inflammatory processes in the pathophysiology of a wide range of chronic degenerative diseases, even though inflammation has long been recognized as a critical line of defense against infectious disease. But current scientific understandings of the links between chronic low-grade inflammation and diseases of aging are based primarily on research in high income nations with low levels of infectious disease, and high levels of overweight/obesity. From a comparative and historical point of view, this epidemiological situation is relatively unique, and may not capture the full range of ecological variation necessary to understand the processes that shape the development of inflammatory phenotypes. The human immune system is characterized by substantial developmental plasticity, and a comparative, developmental, ecological framework is needed to undertand the complex associations among early environments, the regulation of inflammation, and disease. This presentation discusses results from recent studies in the Philippines and lowland Ecuador that reveal low levels of chronic inflammation despite higher burdens of infectious disease, and point toward nutritional and microbial exposures in infancy as important determinants of inflammation in adulthood.&nbsp;By shaping the regulation of inflammation, early environments moderate responses to inflammatory stimuli later in life, with implications for the association between inflammation and chronic diseases. A comparative human biology approach suggests that chronic inflammation may be a &ldquo;disease of affluence&rdquo;, and it points toward promising directions for future research on inflammation and the prevention and treatment of chronic disease.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">All animals harbor beneficial microbes, and one way these microbes can benefit their animal hosts is by increasing the diversity and efficacy of communication signals available to them. The symbiotic hypothesis for mammalian chemical communication posits that bacteria in the specialized scent glands of mammals generate odorous metabolites used by their hosts for communication, and that variation in host chemical signals is, in large part, a product of underlying variation in the bacterial communities inhabiting these glands. An effective test of this hypothesis would require accurate surveys of the bacterial communities in mammals&rsquo; scent glands and complementary data on the odorant profiles of scent secretions&mdash;both of which have been historically lacking. We used next-generation sequencing technologies to deeply survey bacterial communities in the scent glands of wild spotted and striped hyenas. We showed that these communities were dominated by odor-producing, fermentative bacteria, and that the structures of these communities covaried with the volatile fatty acid profiles of scent secretions in both hyena species. The bacterial and odor profiles of secretions differed between spotted and striped hyenas and, controlled for social group, both profiles varied with sex and reproductive state among spotted hyenas. These results strongly support the symbiotic hypothesis for chemical communication, suggesting that symbiotic bacteria underlie species-specific odors in both spotted and striped hyenas, and underlie sex and reproductive state-specific odors among spotted hyenas. These results suggest that symbiotic bacteria are critical contributors to hyenas&rsquo; signaling phenotypes, and that they are therefore important mediators in the complex social lives of hyenas.

	In this presentation we will examine what responsible innovation might mean in a Brazilian context and the challenges that it faces in relation to current &lsquo;live&rsquo; debates on science policy. Using insights from the anthropology and sociology of scientific knowledge, and using research with science policy actors, we will examine the capacities and propensities of research bodies in Brazil to be anticipative, reflexive, inclusive and responsive. This will be scrutinized in relation to key areas of controversy, such as the exploration of deep-sea petroleum (known as "pre-salt") and the development of bio-energy technologies (e.g. ethanol fuel for cars).
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Brazil is currently undergoing a new cycle of heavy investments in infrastructure, an expansion of scientific institutions and an ever-greater focus on promoting innovation through public policies. This context sets forth new challenges for social scientists: how do we reflect on science and technology in relation to specific meanings of "responsibility"? How can social scientists participate in defining policies for science and technology, as well and interfering with how they are implemented? How can we incorporate notions of democratic governance in emerging countries such as Brazil, with specific cultural and historical practices relating to science, technology and innovation?
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The Brazilian context is very rich in terms of the potential for reflection on and practical action in its science and technology infrastructures. As an emerging economy, and also an emerging regional power, Brazil is yet understudied in terms of how it enacts the governance of science and technology. New developments, such as recent oil finds, set forth questions of how an economy still low in carbon emissions from industrial activities might shift to a petroleum-based and industry-heavy context, and how this shift might occur in terms of its policies and its social and ethical principles. Will these developments respect the environment and promote social inclusion? Will they be implemented technocratically as so many projects were during the 1964-1988 military regime? This presentation will explore some of the issues relating to Brazil's current innovation practices and reflect on how they can be carried out responsibly.

	<span lang="EN-US">Since the Great East Japan Earthquake and the consequent tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, many scientific and engineering communities in Japan faced the issue of their social responsibility. The Seismological Society of Japan acknowledged their inability to forecast such a massive earthquake in advance and spoke words of soul-searching. The Meteorological Society of Japan was accused of throttling members and avoiding their social responsibility when the president officially requested the members not to exchange uncertain information on nuclear disaster prevention. The Atomic Energy Society of Japan set up their own investigation committee on the Fukushima nuclear disaster and owned up to their responsibility as an expert community. In any way most communities are satisfied to enhance their expert accountability. However, the issue of social responsibility in Japanese academia becomes more serious on another front as an increasing number of cases of alleged scientific misconduct by Japanese scientists have been reported for the last couple of years. Just a few of these have been confirmed by an ad hoc university investigation committee, but most are likely to be missed by both universities and funding agencies. Traditionally Japanese are based on a situated ethics as local and specific to particular practice in contrast with universalized ethics. This may increase responsiveness to rapidly changing context-specific issues as appreciated in recent social science studies, but the principles and processes of how individual agencies take social responsibility become ill-defined. Against this backdrop, taking cases from nuclear engineering, synthetic biology and human genome research, I would like to discuss that responsible innovation and integrated ethics are now required not only to align scientists with other stakeholders for anticipatory governance, but also to apportion responsibilities between the engaged individuals and their affiliations to avoid organized irresponsibility. For this, intermediaries between the both parties such as scientific communities, funding agencies, institutional review boards, and university research offices are expected to play a more active role.</span>

Over the long term, nanotechnology is expected to enable improvements throughout the energy sector, but the most striking near- to mid-term opportunities may be in lower-cost, higher-efficiency conversion of sunlight to electric power.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">There are multiple ways to improve photovoltaic performance by means of nanostructures in solar cells: (1) employing new physical approaches in order to reach thermodynamic limits; (2) allowing solar cells to more closely approximate their material-dependent thermodynamic limits; and (3) providing new routes for low-cost fabrication by self-assembly or design of new materials. We focus primarily on the first two avenues, both of which have the goal of increasing efficiency.

Special emphasis will be on a novel nanostructure-based devices based on advanced concepts such as hot carrier cells, intermediate band and multi-exciton generation, which offer the theoretical basis to realize high-efficiency energy conversion. In particular, we focus on the role of ultrafast carrier dynamics in nanostructures in terms of the competition between carrier extraction processes and energy relaxation processes that convert electron kinetic energy into heat.&nbsp; We also focus on the effects that surfaces and interfaces play in nanostructured solar cells, and on how to reduce parasitic carrier recombination effects through passivation.

	This talk focuses on energy harvesting in the long-wave regime of the solar spectrum, which cannot be exploited by solar cells due to band gap limitations of photovoltaics. An alternative physical mechanism based on the wave nature of electromagnetic radiation will be discussed, particularly with reference to novel devices that combine thermocouples with nanometer-scale antennas for the long-wave infrared regime. Like radio antennas, these capture electromagnetic waves, but to capture infrared radiation at micron-scale wavelengths they need to be engineered on the nanometer scale. This radiation induces electrical currents in the antennas, leading to local heating effects that can be harvested in nano-scale thermocouples. For efficient energy harvesting, the hot junction of the thermocouple has to be placed at the feed point of the nanoantenna, where the heating effect is strongest. Several thermocouples can be placed in series to form a thermopile, thus maximizing the amount of energy harvested.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">We will discuss several different nanoantenna-nanothermocouple arrangements, focusing on our recent discovery that thermocouples can be realized by a single metal. In conventional thermocouples, the difference in the Seebeck coefficient depends on the use of two different metals; in ours, the difference is provided by shape-engineering of the junction.&nbsp; The use of single-metal thermocouples significantly reduces the complexity of fabrication and opens the possibility of large-scale arrays for infrared energy harvesting applications.

	Laypersons' distrust in science might be due to a lack of understanding, but distrust can also be motivated in the sense that research programs and findings challenge people's "sacred" value systems or their social identity. One area in which motivated biases among laypersons can be fruitfully investigated is research on the (harmful) effects of playing violent video games. In three studies, we found that people who strongly identify with the group of "gamers" devalue research findings (and the respective researchers) if these findings suggest that playing violent video games does have harmful effects. Such research implies a threat to the social identity of highly identified gamers; thus, devaluing it can be understood as a coping response ("collective action") to a social identity threat. Two further studies show that people who consider nonviolence to be a sacred value (i.e., "deontological pacifists") selectively search for research findings that confirm harmful effects of violent video games if their moral value system is threatened. Taken together, these findings suggest that simply teaching laypersons how science works may not be sufficient for building their trust in science. Rather, sincere attempts to (re)build trust in science should take social and moral identity concerns of the general public, and the motivated biases that follow from these concerns, into account.

	This talk examines recent claims that that declining levels of trust in the scientific enterprise are responsible for a lack of support for science among U.S. publics.  Using a combination of data from the General Social Survey since the 1960s and a series of recent national survey data on nanotechnology, nuclear energy and synthetic biology, it (a) shows that levels of trust in science have in fact not declined over time, and (b) examines the relative impact of trust in science on attitudes, when compared to more stable predispositions, such as deference toward scientific authority.

	We, CRDS of JST, are currently trying to develop a methodology of designing issue-driven R&amp;D strategy on the basis of a concept of &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; between identified societal issues and scientific research themes. At the AAAS 2013 Annual Meeting, we proposed and tried a new process comprising multiple steps starting from comprehensive understanding of societal issues and ending by shaping several strategic R&amp;D themes. We are now further elaborating some of these R&amp;D themes.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Based on these experiences, we report the merit of the present methodology in comparison to traditional discipline-based R&amp;D planning, and also the difficulties we faced in designing issue-driven R&amp;D strategy. We also discuss an important issue how to stimulate scientists&rsquo; natural motivation in such issue-driven R&amp;D framework.

	The singular characteristic of cities is change. However, the fundamental processes by which cities develop and are able to catalyze positive change in human societies remain poorly understood.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In this talk I will provide a new emerging picture of theoretical and empirical advances in understanding cities scientifically and its implications for global sustainable development. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">First, I will show evidence for the disproportionate concentration of creative economic and cultural activities in larger cities in developed nations. Next, I will provide very different evidence in developing cities, showing how improvements in urban infrastructure, services and civic inclusion can promote innovation and development. &nbsp;I will also provide examples where such dynamics has not been successful.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">I will then offer a more theoretical perspective on the general mechanisms involved in urban form and function. I will show that a new conceptualization of cities as vast social networks with specific quantitative characteristics helps explain the statistics of creativity in cities and sheds new light on processes of economic diversity and productivity. I will then use these insights to discuss the supportive but not prescriptive role of planning and policy in urban development and the need for a more detailed understanding of the interplay between services and social life in cities, including neighborhood effects.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In closing I will offer my perspective on the massive urbanization underway in developing nations, its current challenges and its opportunities. I will show that, like never before in human history, we are starting to wrap our arms empirically around issues of human development globally and have now a clear and present opportunity for a new interdisciplinary scientific approach to promoting sustainable (urban) development.

	Work conducted at the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) has advanced a vision for small modular reactors (SMR) with a tightly controlled fuel cycle. This involves SMRs with sealed fuel compartments that would not give users access to nuclear materials. In addition, these SMRs would be produced in a &ldquo;hub and spoke&rdquo; arrangement with a small number of manufacturing facilities worldwide and end of life recovery of the modules for recycling and disposal. Critically, this vision for SMRs has the potential to enhance proliferation resistance compared to conventional reactors designs and deployment approaches. However, there has been little effort to evaluate SMR designs, manufacturing arrangements and fuel cycle practices on the proliferation risks for widespread deployment. Here, we develop an expert elicitation to compare the proliferation resistance of different potential nuclear energy generation deployment scenarios

</td><td>7027</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td>11007</td><td>Do Humans Make Southwestern Forests Less Vulnerable to Fire and Climate Changes?</td><td> 

	Forests and communities are now extremely vulnerable to large, severe fires during droughts as a consequence of fire exclusion and other land use practices.&nbsp;The extent to which this vulnerability is influenced by climate and land-use remains unclear.&nbsp; Multi-century case studies reveal that certain types of fire are critical for maintaining the health of forests in the Western U.S. In semi-arid pine forests of the Southwestern U.S., frequent surface fires clean out understory plants, maintain an open stand structure, and improve the resilience of these forests to severe droughts. The removal of these frequent, cool, surface fires during the 20<sup>th</sup> century by fire suppression has changed the fire-forest dynamic. Now, in the context of global warming, severe and extended droughts have turned Southwestern forests into tinderboxes that threaten homes, infrastructure, and the very forests that have attracted so many human communities to these landscapes. The expansion of the human built environment into these fire- and drought-prone forests has created a unique fire and forest management problem referred to as the Wildland Urban Interface or WUI.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Just as paleo-records have illuminated the dynamics of forest fire regimes and their relationship to climate, we look to the past through interdisciplinary socio-ecological research to understand the climate vulnerabilities of human and ecological communities at the WUI. Many of these landscapes were home to agricultural populations for centuries before Euroamerican colonization, seemingly without creating climate vulnerabilities that we are currently experiencing. In the southwestern Jemez Mountains in particular, more than 8,000 Ancestral Jemez villagers lived at population densities equivalent to the modern WUI for at least three centuries, through several severe droughts. We have brought together the insights of archaeology, dendrochronology, paleoecology, traditional ecological knowledge, and dynamic computer simulations to investigate the complex, long-term couplings of forest ecosystems, fire regimes, climate change, and human communities in the Ancestral Jemez landscape. This interdisciplinary research focuses on evaluating whether or not particular fire-forest-society relationships can enhance or erode the resilience of these fire-adapted forests. Our ongoing research addresses this question at multiple scales from the daily lived environment of the human communities, across their agricultural landscape, and beyond to encompass a mosaic of humanized, coupled human-natural, and natural landscape patches.

	Despite the characterization of the Green Revolution as a market-driven transformation, farmer-to-farmer transfers underpinned the rapid diffusion of modern wheat varieties in the Asian subcontinent. Nearly a half-century later, in that same region, some evidence suggests that the variety replacement needed to maintain yield potential in major crops such as wheat is still dominated by exchanges based on social relationships. Farmer-to-farmer seed transfer, via gifts, exchange, or sale, is even more pronounced among marginalized, smaller-scale farmers and minor crops, where formal trade of certified seed is sparse.  This presentation will draw on recent empirical research conducted across crops and developing country contexts to explore the linkages between the structure of the local seed trade and the intra-specific biodiversity of the crops on which poor people depend for their livelihoods.

	Protoplanetary disks evolve through gas accretion onto the star, photo-evaporation, coagulation and settling of dust grains, and planet formation. With the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) we can now see fine details of disk structure, gas chemistry, and dust trapping. With the Very Large Array (VLA), we can witness the first steps in the growth of planetesimals. Together with studies of exoplanets, these observations of the processes of planet formation will help us understand the origins of our solar system and how common its architecture is.

</td><td>7033</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td>11019</td><td>Dust Growth in Protoplanetary Disks: The First Step Toward Planet Formation</td><td> 

	The vast majority of young pre-main sequence stars are surrounded by gaseous accretion disks. This circumstellar material provides a large reservoir, up to a few percent of the total mass of the star, that is available for the eventual formation of planets. Hence, these disks are generally designated as protoplanetary. Although dust constitutes about one percent of the total disk mass, it can dramatically obscure the emission from the disk and the central star in the visible part of the spectrum. Fortunately, telescopes that operate at much longer wavelengths, such as ALMA and VLA, can peer into these dust-shrouded regions and witness the earliest planet formation stage: the growth of microscopic dust grains into macroscopic dust pebbles.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Sub-micron-sized dust grains originate in the interstellar medium, and get incorporated to the disk during the proto-stellar collapse. The smallest of the dust particles easily grow to larger sizes, since random Brownian motions facilitate non-destructive collisions in a short timescale. Large dust particles decouple from the gas and quickly settle toward the disk mid-plane, sweeping up other particles and growing. But once macroscopic sizes are reached (centimeter to decimeter sizes), collisional coagulation efficiencies drop and the outcome of collisions is either fragmentation or bouncing. At this point, the interaction of these grains with the gaseous disk is critical: gas drag reduces their angular momentum and large particles rapidly spiral inwards into the star, failing to stay in the disk reservoir. Yet, it is these macroscopic grains that will eventually become the building blocks of planets, and somehow they must survive. There is currently an active effort to develop better theoretical models and design more realistic laboratory experiments, but direct observational constraints on particle growth in circumstellar disks are critical to improve our understanding of this astrophysical process.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">From an observational point of view, grain growth can be inferred by measuring the spectral energy distribution of circumstellar disks at long wavelengths, which traces the continuum dust emission spectrum and hence the dust opacity. Several observational studies indicate an evolution of the dust component in protoplanetary disks, suggesting at least 4 orders of magnitude growth in particle size. Furthermore, thanks to now-available spatially resolved observations of circumstellar disks at multiple millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, evidence on a radial dependance of the dust properties inside the disk has been obtained. In this talk, I will discuss these recent observational constraints and its comparison with physical models of grain evolution that include collisional coagulation, fragmentation, and the interaction of these grains with the gaseous disk (the radial-drift problem). Current results suggest that the first step toward planet formation is modulated by the interaction of millimeter and centimeter-sized dust grains with the gaseous disk.

	While in the last decades a large part of the observations of solar system bodies were obtained from planetary missions, the capabilities of the new ground-based (sub)millimeter and cm facilities now put this technique at the forefront of solar system exploration. Such observations allow to retrieve unique physical and chemical properties that are essential to fully characterize the individual bodies, to identify processes acting on atmospheres and surfaces, as well as to derive clues pertaining to the formation and evolution of the solar system at large. <br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Observations of the surface thermal continuum emission from rocky planets and small bodies are indicative of the surface and subsurface brightness temperature field, that can be modeled to derive surface properties including albedo, roughness (related to soil porosity) and thermal inertia. In addition, the combined analysis of thermal and optical observations through the radiometric method allows to determine the equivalent size of small, spatially unresolved bodies.<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Amongst molecules that are often present as minor components in planetary atmospheres, several display strong (sub)millimeter rotational lines (CO, HCN, HDO, SO2,...) formed at altitudes above a few hundreds millibars. Modeling of the lines' profiles allows to derive the temperature and molecular abundance vertical profiles in atmospheric regions that are rarely probed by other techniques. When a sufficient spatial resolution is reached, the combined retrieval of temperature, wind (through Doppler-shift mapping) and composition horizontal fields is a powerful tool to constrain the global atmospheric structure, and to identify seasonal and diurnal cycles.<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In this talk, I will provide an overview of the possibilities offered by (sub)mm and cm observations for the field of solar system science in the context of ALMA and EVLA. I will focus on a few topics illustrating the diversity of science cases that can be adressed: the chemical characterization of the tenuous atmosphere of Jupiter's volcanic moon Io, the mapping of Neptune's atmosphere from the deep troposphere to the stratosphere, the determination of the atmospheric wind regimes in Venus' middle atmosphere, and the retrieval of the size distribution in the Kuiper Belt.

	Geography is important in genetically improving crops. The selection of environments to breed and the characterization of target environments for which crops are bred determine to a high extent the success of breeding programmes. In research for smallholder farmers, who often work in more marginal and therefore more temporally and spatially variable environments, this is even more critical. Plant breeders, however, often rely on intuition to select trial sites or to analyze crop responses to particular environmental conditions and to weight the importance of particular stresses on plants in agriculture. This can lead to suboptimal investments. Climate change can be expected to exacerbate this problem. Therefore, more geographical research is needed to guide plant breeding. I review the literature on (1) climate variability and climate change and its impact on crops and (2) geographical methods to support plant breeding. I describe a framework to determine and iteratively update and improve the spatial arrangements to optimize participatory-evolutionary breeding programmes (“what to select for where”). I suggest that mobile technology and crowdsourcing approaches can help to gather more detailed information about specific niches in complex landscapes where crops are grown and the response of crops to specific environmental conditions.

An original approach and analytic framework are also presented. Conceptually the paper provides an integrated framework for global agrobiodiversity analysis through three groups of related subfields: (i) biogeography, ecology, and human-cultural ecology; (ii) global and land change sciences; (iii) conservation, development studies with emphasis on political ecology, and sustainability science The paper briefly reviews the major geographic treatments of global agrobiodiversity and agrobiodiversity-change beginning with Vavilov and including subsequent genetic-resource and crop evolutionary ecological schema, with emphasis on current global-scale models, GAP analysis, multiple hotspot frameworks, and dispersal-generated, spatial-network estimations. It then introduces and discusses the methodological design and implementation of an innovative approach utilizing expert knowledge systems, computer-interface and GIScience-based mapping, and geographic modeling. The following section discusses new findings and geospatial estimates of the multi-crop, region- and landscape-scale identification of agrobiodiversity hotspots. This new approach is used to describe and characterize global agrobiodiversity hotspots through the fusion of data sources followed by modeling of geospatial parameters in conjunction with socioeconomic attributes and seed-network capacities. Multiple case study examples will be discussed, as well as inputs into global-scale models. The results will be used to outline and assess challenges and specific opportunities for sustainability policy and management enhancing the social-ecological resilience of agriculture and lessening vulnerabilities.

	In this paper the author&nbsp;&nbsp; looks&nbsp;&nbsp; at how our notions of biological, social and historical race play out in our institutions and in our everyday lives and in our discourses or everyday conversations, in our media and in our popular culture.&nbsp; In 2013, at the end of the first decade of the 21st Century, we still have very real repercussions in our national institutions and in our lives from the power of both the concept and reality of believing that race is real, both biologically and culturally. While, in the paper the author has established the fact that &ldquo;race&rdquo; is a social construct, the reality is that there are still racial disparities in every aspect of our society. There is no basis in reality for the statements often heard in political and policy circles that we live in a &ldquo;post-racial world&rdquo; or that we should be striving for a &ldquo;colorblind society.&rdquo; As long as structural and institutional racism exist, and there is a racialized social hierarchy in which those in power (economic, social and political) are still in place, true racial equity is a myth. All of the conversations about race that we have in this country will not change those racialized status and power dynamics. This continues to be a fruitful area of research well into the 21st century. We still have much to learn about the intractability of this deeply embedded system of privilege in our society.

	Color-blind racism is an ideology in which persons of the dominant socially-defined race (European Americans) claim that racism is no longer the central factor determining the life chances of persons of non-European descent (particularly dark-skinned individuals of African descent.) They argue that instead of the ongoing institutional and individual racism of American society; that non-racial factors such as market dynamics, naturally occurring phenomena, and the cultural attitudes of minorities themselves are the main causal factors of their social subordination. In addition to social subordination, African Americans and other ethnic/racial groups also display pronounced patterns of health disparity (measured by increased morbidity and mortality rates) compared to European Americans. With the development of modern genomics techniques an increasingly genomic determinism narrative is developing around these health disparities. This narrative is particularly influential in biomedical research and clinical practice despite the growing consensus that anatomically-modern humans does not have biological races, and certainly if there are biological races that such races do not match American socially-defined categories. This talk will outline the nature of human genomic variation, why that variation does not justify the classification of biological races within the species, but also why knowledge of genomic differences between populations alone is insufficient to address their patterns of health disparity.&nbsp; Furthermore it will explain why membership in a socially-defined race has real biological consequences; including reducing the mental and physical well-being of the socially-subordinated.

	The virtual human concept is a compelling one, offering an in silico environment within which truly personalised medicine can be implemented, taking into account the specific features of every one of us as an individual, from our personal genome to the anatomy of our connected organ systems. Such virtual humans will not only support medical and clinical treatment and decision making, they will also reduce the need for animal testing and serve as personal avatars which will assist every one of us in making healthcare and lifestyle choices.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The modelling, software and computational challenges associated with the virtual human are immense and will require many years of intensive research effort to bring to fruition. However, the modern principles of modular assembly of tried and tested components will take advantage of the considerable progress already being made in many aspects of the overall virtual human.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Indeed, building virtual humans presents a multiscale challenge, as we must integrate data and models at every level ranging between molecular, sub-cellular, cells, tissues and organs (and even beyond the single human to population health to address epidemiological issues). This is probably the most ambitious project for what is often called "systems biology". To make progress at this stage in the development of high fidelity virtual humans, we invoke Sydney Brenner's famous phrase and address its various components &ldquo;from the middle out". My talk will outline several biomedical issues which are being addressed today, based on various components of the future virtual human. These examples illustrate how future patient-specific medicine treatments will draw increasingly on the massive power of modern IT systems, including both big data and high performance computing aspects. The examples address patient-specific HIV and cancer drug therapy as well as personalised treatment of aneurysms in the brain.

	This presentation describes a methodology for the simulation of musculoskeletal disorders.Our clinical study is related to osteoarthritis of the hip, a pathogenesis possibly due to impingements. These bone collisions lead to abnormal joint mechanics which is characterized by contact pressure and stress distribution upon the joint cartilages.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The proposed methodology combines different approaches from modeling to 3D&nbsp;simulation.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The simulation is based on patient-specific anatomical models, where acquisition modalities are non invasive and flexible. Based on static MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data, a discrete deformable models method is used for modeling the organs of the musculoskeletal system. Femoroacetabular movements are estimated using an optical motion capture system and are validated by a dynamic MRI analysis. To achieve accurate deformations, techniques to generate volumetric meshes are developed based on the medial axis information. Finally, a computationally-efficient fast functional joint model is used to simulate the mechanical behavior of the soft tissues. The goal of such a simulation is to allow the investigation of the relevant contact and cartilages deformation under movement, which can be useful for diagnosis, pre- or post- operative planning and training. This will benefit further developments in surgical techniques and minimally invasive procedures. A complete case study has been done on 6 ballerinas who&nbsp;perform daily extreme motions. It was possible to identify the cartilage deformation while a ballerina was dancing. We have also shown&nbsp;a&nbsp;correspondence with the information&nbsp;obtained&nbsp;from&nbsp; MRI data set.

	The nucleosynthesis of elements beyond iron is dominated by neutron captures in the s and r processes. However, 32 stable, proton-rich isotopes cannot be formed during those processes, because they are shielded from the s process flow and r process beta-decay chains. For all of three processes, current research in nuclear astrophysics addresses the need for better data of nuclear reactions, which involve radioactive isotopes. Depending on the particular reaction, direct or inverse kinematics, forward or time-inversed direction are investigated to better constrain the desired reaction cross sections. The National Ignition Facility offers unique, unprecedented opportunities to investigate some of the important reactions in a completely complementary approach. The high densities and temperatures in the plasma allow the investigation under almost stellar conditions. The experimental challenge is, however, the extreme short time during which such conditions are available.

	A group of five paintings on canvas known as Mark Rothko&rsquo;s Harvard Murals (1962) has changed color due to the presence of a fugitive red pigment (Lithol Red) and excessive exposure to natural light in a room with large windows. This project explores the possibility of recreating the original color appearance by using a digital projector as illumination. A camera-projector system determines the characteristics of the painted surface and the projector&rsquo;s non-linear response. By comparison with a target image we calculate a corrective image that is projected onto the paintings. Using this augmented reality approach we can recreate the original color appearance without physically altering the painting.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"><b>&nbsp;</b><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Restored Kodak Ektachrome photographs of the paintings in their original state from 1963 serve as a reference. These transparencies which have also faded over the last 50 years are scanned using narrow bandwidth light sources ensuring that the recorded optical densities are proportional to the photographic dye concentrations.&nbsp; The original color of the Ektachromes is then digitally reconstructed using a chemical fading model based on these dye concentrations. Further digital processing is required to compensate for the overemphasis of red in the Ektachrome film and the uneven illumination of the paintings when photographed.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">With a camera-projector system we calculate the geometric mapping and the radiometric compensation. The geometric mapping yields the coordinate transformations between the projector, the camera, and the digital target image. Subsequently, the color mixing matrix and nonlinear projector response are calculated. With all parameters of the system known, we can calculate the compensation image pixel by pixel and project it with the correct registration onto the faded canvas.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">This novel restoration technique uses colored light from a digital projector to compensate for color alteration. To our knowledge this approach has not been used for the restoration of paintings before. It recreates the original color appearance without physically changing the paint surface and is therefore completely reversible. In fact, one can easily compare the unrestored and color corrected object by switching the projector on or off. Microfading tests insure that the paintings will not continue to fade as a result of this treatment. As a result, Mark Rothko&rsquo;s Harvard Murals can be viewed and experienced as in 1962.

	What explains the current low rate of employment in the US? &nbsp;In this paper, we argue that the year 2000 represents a turning point for the economy in the sense that there has been a major shift in skill demands. In the decades leading up to 2000, many observers have documented a strong growth in the demand for skills and workers performing cognitive tasks. As we document, starting at the turn of the century, the strong demand for skills reverses while the supply of skills continues to grow. In response to this demand shift, we show that high-skill workers move down the occupational ladder and have begun to perform jobs traditionally performed by lower-skilled workers. As a result of this de-skilling process, high-skill workers push low-skilled workers further down the occupational ladder and out of the labor force all together. In order to understand these patterns, we offer a simple extension to the standard skill biased technical change model that views cognitive tasks as a stock rather than a flow. We show how such a model can explain the trends in the data that we present, and offers a novel interpretation of the current employment situation in the US.

	The secured supply of precious and special metals - essential for high-tech applications - is increasingly considered critical for the European economy. End of life products such as electronics and cars are an important &ldquo;urban mine&rdquo; for these metals which can be exploited through comprehensive recycling. E.g., annual sales of mobile phones and computers alone account for 4% of world mine production of gold and silver and even make 20% for palladium and cobalt.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">However, for this purpose the existing recycling approaches designed for flows of mass materials are insufficient. It is important to develop instead highly efficient process chains that also gain high yields with "technology metals&rdquo; present only in traces. In technical perspective, many metals can be recycled with high yields, using state-of-the-art recycling plants. The challenge though lies in ensuring the collection of scrap and in the capacity and technical capabilities optimized for each product type through the different stages of the recycling chain. A highly efficient metallurgical recycling process is not sufficient as long as collection rates are poor and high losses occur in dismantling and pre-processing. The latter plays a key role, since the complex and heterogeneous products have to be "decomposed" and treated in such a way that the output fractions generated can reach the most appropriate final metallurgical processes needed to produce pure metals for a new lifecycle. Heterogeneity and complexity of products as well as their design and types of material interconnections used impact the optimal process set-up and determine the limits of recycling. Considerable improvement potentials exists both in product design for recycling/disassembly as well in selecting the most suitable processing option.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">For effective recycling 7 consecutive requirements must be met:
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">1. Technical recyclability of the material / component (prerequisite)
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">2. Accessibility of the relevant component
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">3. Economic viability (intrinsically or externally created

	David Peck, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The subject of critical materials is part of the &lsquo;wicked challenges&rsquo; of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As Stahel states, the rate of <em>per capita</em>&nbsp;material consumption in the World is presenting serious challenges to the wellbeing to all living things on Earth. A number of publications have tackled the subject of critical materials from a range of perspectives, using differing criteria to define criticality. A wide range of products and equipment contains critical materials. The subject of has come to the attention of product manufacturers and governments over recent years. Materials are selected at the product design stage and this fact is both a significant contributor to the problem and also a good place to seek solutions. Even though product design could play a valuable role in finding solutions to the challenge, this is not being widely translated into activity in companies.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Part of the reason for this hesitancy on the part of companies is that in many cases there is simply a lack of awareness and for some a lack of clarity.&nbsp; In the case of a lack of clarity, there appears to have evolved a &lsquo;Malthus vs Solow dueling&rsquo; situation, as proposed by Martin &amp; Kemper. On one side research proposes rapid and wide ranging &lsquo;resource efficiency&rsquo; measures be imposed, whilst on the other side research proposes that the challenge will be best addressed by scientific &amp; technological developments over the coming years. There has, however, been a lack of academic research to show how companies view the situation.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In order to address this gap companies have been interviewed on the topic. The interviews explored the wider company critical materials knowledge, role of these materials, risk management strategies, business opportunities and future support needs. This new knowledge has developed our understanding of the perceived level of urgency concerning critical materials supply risks and if this urgency does translate into the selection of a more &lsquo;Malthus or Solow&rsquo; based response.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Following these findings the principles of a circular economy, with a focus on circular product design in particular, are being developed with companies.&nbsp; These developments are presented as the optimal approach from product design to address critical materials and presents a roadmap out of the &lsquo;Malthus or Solow&rsquo; stalemate.

</td><td>7045</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td>11085</td><td>How Much Natural Hazard Mitigation is Enough?</td><td> 

	Defending against natural disasters is a high-stakes game of chance. Sometimes nature surprises us, when an earthquake or hurricane has unexpectedly large effects. Other times, nature outsmarts us, doing great damage despite expensive mitigation, or causing us to divert resources to mitigate overestimated hazards.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">&nbsp;This situation may seem surprising because of the steady advances being made in the science of natural hazards. Much of the problem comes from the fact that formulating effective natural hazard policy involves using a complicated combination of science and economics to analyze a problem and explore the costs and benefits of different options, in situations where the future is very uncertain. In general, mitigation policies are chosen without such analysis. Typically, communities have not looked at different options, and choose one or having one chosen for them without knowing what they're paying or what they're getting. This is like buying insurance without considering how much a policy will cost and what the benefits would be. Not surprisingly, the results are often disappointing.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">&nbsp;To do better involves developing policies that make sense, given our limited resources, limited knowledge about the hazards, and thus limited ability to estimate possible future damage. The issue can be posed in terms of finding a level of mitigation that minimizes total cost to society. That cost is the sum of mitigation costs, such as earthquake resistant construction, plus the expected loss for future events. The expected loss is the sum of losses in various expected events times the assumed probability of each event. The optimal level of mitigation is the minimum of the cost curve. Less mitigation decreases construction costs but increases the expected loss and thus total cost. More mitigation gives less expected loss but higher total cost. Our ability to find such an optimal level of mitigation that balances resources used for hazard mitigation with other societal needs (schools, hospitals, etc.), thus depends on our ability to estimate the probabilities of future events and their effects, and the uncertainties in these estimates.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Fortunately, our analysis illustrates two crucial points. First, a nonoptimal mitigation strategy - which is usually the case because the decisions are made politically rather than via economic analysis - still does more good than doing nothing as long as it is not so extreme that the mitigation costs exceed the benefit of reduced losses. Second, inaccurate hazard and/or loss estimates &ndash; which we always have - still are useful as long as it they not too much of an overestimate. Given that natural hazards assessments and estimates of the resulting losses have large uncertainties, it is encouraging that any estimate that does not greatly overestimate the hazard and loss leads to a mitigation strategy that is better than doing nothing. Hence although there is no unique solution, thoughtful analysis can help society do better.

	The delivery of improved crop varieties is core to sustaining agricultural productivity among the largely resource poor subsistence farming communities in Africa. The hot and humid climate presents an environment for many crop pest and disease organisms to flourish hence the high diversity observed and common outbreak of new diseases afflicting crop productivity. Other constrains relate to declining soil fertility and drought. Micronutrient deficiencies are also common leading to malnutrition, anaemia, blindness and stunting in communities who cannot have a balanced diet regularly. In order to overcome these challenges there is need to expand crop breeding technologies of African adapted crops. Researchers at the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) of Uganda realised the limitations of traditional breeding to deliver novel varieties with local preferences and adopted modern biotechnology to complement conventional breeding. Through both Government and development partner support, NARO has developed capacity in genetic engineering of local varieties of crops such as banana as well as contained and confined field evaluation of GM crops. Being signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, laws are required to regulate GM research, while these were under development, the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology, used existing laws to develop a framework within which research can continue. It is through this that NARO has undertaken 5 GM field trials of banana for black Sigatoka disease resistance, vitamin A and iron bio-fortification, and bacterial wilt resistance, nematode and weevil stem borer resistance; 3 GM field trials of cassava for cassava mosaic virus and brown streak virus resistance. Other crops include 3 trials of water efficient maize; and 4 trials of ball worm resistant and herbicide tolerant cotton. This paper presents the objectives of the various technologies being evaluated in relation to national development in Uganda and Africa. It discusses the regulatory environment that has been successful in facilitating GM research in absence of a substantive law and progress towards commercial release of some of these products.

	In a quest to reduce hunger, food insecurity and poverty through agriculture, African governments agreed to increase public investment in agriculture &nbsp;by committing a minimum of 10 per cent of their national budgets to agriculture with the aim of raising agricultural productivity by at least 6 per cent by 2015. To achieve this, a mixture of both conventional and biotechnological approaches would be required. African countries are making steady progress towards developing and implementing domestic frameworks that comply with the main multilateral framework, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB). The African Biosafety Network of Expertise (ABNE) was conceived under the auspices of the NEPAD Agency by African leaders to build functional biosafety system including the capacity of African regulators in all aspects of regulatory regimes.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">To enhance the regulatory systems in Africa, the following have been suggested: availability and sustainability of financial resources to the regulatory systems; the need for integration of multiple actors with multiple agendas; access to credit by farmers to buy GE seed; capacity to enforce regulations; capacity for inspection and monitoring; increase public awareness; access to accurate information on biotech/biosafety; adequate infrastructure; timely and adequate seed supply; nascent public-private sector partnerships; and improved linkages in public-private partnerships.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The political dimension of genetic engineering(GE) was and still is the outstanding problem on its regulation in Africa and is mainly attributed to Africa&rsquo;s policy-making elites. Some early adopter countries warmed up to GE technology and later observed with some elements of &lsquo;backsliding&rsquo; due to the misinformation and activisms.

Genetic Modification is the most powerful tool and leads to the development of products in agriculture not otherwise possible with conventional approaches. They enhance the potential of conventional techniques to address food security and the reduction of loss of biodiversity. Despite this and the track record of safety, the adoption of GM approaches has met resistance in many areas of Africa.

	Decisions are said to be &ldquo;risky&rdquo; when they are made in environments with uncertainty caused by nature. In contrast, a decision is said to be &ldquo;trusting&rdquo; when its outcome depends on the uncertain decisions of another person. A rapidly expanding literature reveals economically important differences between risky and trusting decisions, and further suggests these differences are due to &ldquo;betrayal aversion&rdquo;. While its neural foundations have not been previously illuminated, the prevailing hypothesis is that betrayal aversion stems from a desire to avoid negative emotions that arise from learning one&rsquo;s trust was betrayed. Here we provide evidence from an fMRI study that supports this hypothesis. In particular, our data indicate that anterior insula modulates trusting decisions that involve the possibility of betrayal.

Many people are uneasy about agricultural biotechnology which seems to be advancing faster than their awareness and knowledge levels. Matters are not help by two frames of the technology (negative and positive) that are being championed by bitterly opposed sides of the biotechnology divide. &nbsp;Consequently, public mistrust and, in some cases, outright hostility has bred a climate of deep anxiety among scientists, law makers and policy makers. Yet, modern agricultural biotechnology has been identified as one of the technologies that can help Africa to revive and boost its falling agricultural productivity and reduce food insecurity on the continent. However, biotechnology products have met with fierce opposition from groups opposed to them for various reasons, including concerns over their safety. As a result, adoption of biotechnology crops in Africa has been lagging behind other continents, leaving the region even more vulnerable to hunger, malnutrition and poverty. Only four countries in Africa (South Africa, Egypt, Burkina Faso and Sudan) have so far commercialized transgenic crops. Policy makers in&nbsp;Africa are reluctant to institute facilitative biosafety frameworks to govern agricultural biotechnology research, development and commercialization due to the unresolved controversies surrounding biotechnology products. Such irrational policy behaviors can only be avoided by building the confidence of policy makers and the public through sharing credible information and knowledge on all aspects of the technology. The Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB) was initiated specifically to address&nbsp;biotechnology knowledge and awareness deficits by providing a platform for sober exchange of information, experiences and knowledge. This presentation will highlight some of the opportunities and challenges facing biosciences communication in Africa and call for strategic partnerships to overcome the challenges so that Africa can also exploit the huge opportunities presented by areas of biosciences including biotechnology. This global partnership is necessary because experience shows that European biotechnology regulatory policies, for example, to a large extent determine institutional, policy and regulatory arrangements and decisions that misgovern biotechnology in many African countries.

	<b><i>Abstract</i></b><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">A typical characteristic of African agriculture is the predominance of small scale farmers (&gt;60%), mostly women who are semi-skilled and with little access to technology, inputs, credit and markets. Migration of young people from rural to urban areas has left food production in the hands of their elderly parents, most of whom incapable of adjusting to modern high-tech farming systems. But the big question is: How can the youth be attracted and retained in the agricultural sector given their view of farming as painful and low-end labour market? This paper argues for a fundamental change in the mindsets of African youths to view themselves as key players in the food production chain. This can be possible if farming becomes pleasurable and profitable with supportive infrastructure to make it exciting, worthwhile and recognized as an important cornerstone of modern society. &nbsp;Access to efficient agri-biotechnologies, high-quality seeds and inputs, links to markets integrated with the fast-growing techno-entrepreneurship (ICT) and social mobilization will be essential. A good starting point would be to facilitate youth with a first degree in agriculture or biological sciences to establish low-cost tissue-culture business facilities at community level to avail clean planting materials of Africa&rsquo;s major staple crops such as banana, cassava and sweetpotato. African governments should also start considering young people&rsquo;s views and perceptions in policy-making and in reviewing agricultural and biosciences education curricular. As well, radical measures such as use of celebrities to spearhead food security campaigns could ignite passion for agriculture among youths like it is doing in other social spheres. Platforms should be explored to promote successful youthful role models in agriculture through popular social media for example, Facebook, Twitter etc. where young farmer entrepreneurs could share their experiences. With better opportunities for access to technologies, entrepreneurial skills and social marketing, young people could funnel their youthful idealism, energy and determination into a positive force for change within the agricultural sector. This would ultimately result in sustainable production of the food required to feed the growing population of today and the future.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Analogical problem solving is a powerful process that involves mapping structures between problems and generalizing learned strategies from one task to another. We will summarize several studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of analogical transfer as a tool for teaching and learning in a core area of STEM education, specifically fundamental scientific processing skills: formulating hypotheses, designing valid experiments, interpreting data, and evaluating evidence. Each study focuses on how analogy functions as a learning mechanism in elementary school children&rsquo;s acquisition and transfer of the domain-general principles of scientific reasoning.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">When teaching scientific reasoning strategies, the basic analogy approach involves presenting, first, source examples through which children have the opportunity to acquire scientific processing strategies and, second, analogous target tasks to which children can transfer the learned strategies. The studies indicate that the analogy approach effectively helps elementary school children to learn scientific reasoning strategies. The results further suggest techniques to facilitate the acquisition and transfer of these reasoning strategies: 1) present multiple isomorphic source examples that share the same problem structure and require the same general strategy but differ in superficial features. Experiencing such diverse source tasks encourages comparison processes that boost children&rsquo;s subsequent transfer; 2) ask systematic probing questions, such as those that encourage learners to generate examples of an idea or explanations of their own reasoning. Probing questions like these can help children to pay attention to important features of the source examples or to notice their own misconceptions; and 3) provide children with implicit and explicit feedback. Both implicit feedback, gleaned by children as they interact with the tasks and adapt their approaches accordingly, and explicit feedback, offered by the instructor following children&rsquo;s exploration of and/or solutions to the tasks, can facilitate subsequent generalization of the strategies. The above approaches proved effective in promoting children&rsquo;s analogical transfer of scientific reasoning strategies in both laboratory and classroom settings. The theoretical and educational implications for the science of learning and for classroom science education are discussed.

	Humans actively use behavioral synchrony such as dancing and singing when they intend to make affiliative relationships. Such advanced synchronous movement occurs even unconsciously when we hear rhythmically complex music. A foundation for this tendency may be an evolutionary adaptation for group living but evolutionary origins of human synchronous activity is unclear. Here I introduce our study showing that our closest living relatives, chimpanzees, spontaneously synchronize their movements with auditory rhythms: After a training to tap illuminated keys on an electric keyboard, one chimpanzee spontaneously aligned her tapping with the sound when she heard an isochronous distractor sound. Another chimpanzee also spontaneously coordinated his tapping timing to the auditory rhythm. These results suggest that sensitivity to, and tendency toward synchronous movement with an auditory rhythm already existed in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, although humans may have expanded it to unique forms of auditory and visual communication during the course of human evolution.

	One of the greatest challenges of the 21st century is managing our deep ocean sustainably, for it is vast, remote, difficult to access, and highly vulnerable to disturbance.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep ocean covers two thirds of our planet and provides key ecosystem services &ndash; sequestering carbon, cycling nutrients, buffering the ocean, and hosting a wealth of habitats, life forms and genetic diversity needed for the planet to survive. As we deplete resources on land and in the coastal zone, there is an inexorable push into deeper water &ndash; for fish and shellfish, for energy, and for minerals.&nbsp; Advanced technology is both creating the demand for resources and driving our abilities to extract them from increasingly greater depths. At the same time the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and in the ocean is changing conditions in the deep sea, with potential loss of resilience. &nbsp;The growing industrialization of our deep ocean intensifies the need for comprehensive ecosystem-based management that occurs across industrial sectors, in both international and national jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploiting the wealth of the deep ocean, while maintaining the integrity of its ecosystems, their diversity, functions and services will require a cross-disciplinary conversation and interdisciplinary research. These must occur at the intersection of biodiversity, climate science, law, policy, and resource economics.&nbsp; Full stakeholder engagement and a global reach are fundamental to success in this endeavor.

	As the world&rsquo;s demand for minerals and metals continues to rise, along with land resources becoming increasingly stretched, a holistic view of our planet &ndash; which includes the sea - is needed when making decisions about resource supply.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Seafloor-based mineral deposits can offer many environmental and social advantages for mineral development compared to similar land-based operations.&nbsp; These advantages include high metal grades and minimal &lsquo;overburden&rsquo; (unwanted material), resulting in less waste than what is typically produced on land.&nbsp; There is also a small social footprint, in that no one needs to be relocated for extraction to proceed, resulting in reduced pressure on land which is already experiencing increased conflicts over its use.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Of course these advantages should not be taken as a &lsquo;green light&rsquo; to take a no-care attitude towards the environment or environmental management and, as always, balance is needed between meeting the demands of society with environmental protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Examples exist where science and industry (and other stakeholders) have successfully worked together to develop strategies for responsible environmental management of seafloor-based resources at individual sites.&nbsp; The approaches, experiences and strategies thus far developed form a good basis for further developing strategies to enusre responsible environmental management occurs on a wider, more regional, scale as society continues to explore new parts of our planet,&nbsp;including the deep sea,&nbsp;to help meet its demands.

	Endowed with both rich biological and mineral resources, the coastal upwelling waters off Namibia are targeted by exploitation of both. The rich fishery resources have provided lucrative industries for decades and since the independence of Namibia in 1990 are under exemplary management.&nbsp; However recent applications to bulk-dredge the offshore sediments for recovery of phosphate has led to serious environmental concerns and major questions as to whether the sustainable fisheries will not suffer if such mining goes ahead, and put at risk the livelihoods that the important fishing sector supports. Namibia is cautious to be the first-in-the-world to embark on this type of bulk seabed mining, insisting that thorough scientific and socio-economic information is needed before any decisions are made. For this a moratorium period on seabed mining for industrial minerals has recently been declared by the Government of Namibia. Most developing countries face similar predicaments - how to increase GDP and urgently reduce high unemployment - so that new ventures to exploit their natural resources are tempting. Particularly in developing countries, access to relevant data and information is a critical need, which is rarely met, and the governments of these countries are challenged to make hasty decisions without appropriate scientific backing.

	Government leaders at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in June 2012 recognized that the oceans, seas and coastal areas form an integrated and essential component of the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem and are critical to sustaining life on Earth as we know it.&nbsp; Implementing the Rio+20 ocean commitments in the deep sea creates a need for innovative laws and policies. This talk will highlight the present regulatory environment and propose solutions to enhance integrated ecosystem-based management and planning across boundaries and sectors for the largest ecosystem on the planet.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Today, the deep ocean is far from the pristine paradise of strange creatures and exotic ecosystems we envision it to be. &nbsp;Human activities including oil exploitation (aka Deepwater Horizon), fishing, cable laying, discharges from ships and shore, biosprospecting and even deep sea tourism are going deeper and deeper and farther from land. &nbsp;James Cameron just dove 10,000 meters deep.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Deep seabed mining is now on the horizon, coming at the same time as knowledge of the potentially vast impacts of climate change and ocean acidification is maturing. Yet much remains unknown. &nbsp;This combination of unregulated or partially regulated activities, growing impacts and poor knowledge makes deep ocean planning and governance a profound challenge but also of vital importance if we are to ensure sustainable development for all.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides the primary legal framework for ocean activities. What it lacks however are provisions for integrated, ecosystem-based and systematic planning and management. Most maritime legal frameworks, both national and global, are sector driven, focusing on one single activity, with little capacity to incorporate cumulative impacts or effective design principles for conservation.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">This talk &nbsp;will review the gaps and weaknesses in UNCLOS as well as propose ways to address them with the aim of fulfilling the Rio+20 commitment to &ldquo;protect, and restore, the health, productivity and resilience of oceans and marine ecosystems, and to maintain their biodiversity, enabling their conservation and sustainable use for present and future generations, and to effectively apply an ecosystem approach and the precautionary approach in the management, in accordance with international law, of activities impacting on the marine environment, to deliver on all three dimensions of sustainable development.&rdquo;

	<span>Medical technologies arising from the convergence of physical and life sciences research play an increasingly important role in medicine today.&nbsp; During the past decade, new interdisciplinary fields like molecular imaging, biomaterials, tissue engineering, and bioinformatics have emerged as ideas from these two branches of science coalesced into discoveries, theories, and innovative new technologies. The convergence of molecular biology, cell biology, and clinical science together with these precisely engineered technologies make precision medicine an increasing reality. </span><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"><span>The diagnosis and monitoring of cancer benefit from this new reality. While commonly based on histology of biopsied tissues and blood tests cancer diagnosis and monitoring is increasingly enhanced by high resolution imaging technologies such as computed tomography, ultrasound, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging that can detect and characterize abnormal tissues non-invasively.&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi-modal and molecular imaging technologies provide additional advantages in the spatial and temporal characteristics of in vivo processes that are biomarkers of disease.&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, researchers are using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in clinical trials to monitor the dynamic reaction of pyruvate metabolism to lactate to quantitatively image the aggressiveness of prostate cancer less than a decade after the initial proof of principle.&nbsp; This powerful non-invasive imaging technology, which resulted from the convergence of physics, engineering, chemistry with clinical science, is rapidly emerging as a generalizable method for imaging the &ldquo;Krebs cycle&rdquo; and other metabolic pathways in vivo.&nbsp; </span><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"><span>Drug development and delivery using targeted molecular therapeutics is another example of converging technologies emerging today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapeutics for a number of cancers, most notably breast, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancer have been developed&nbsp;to target signal transduction, protein expression, and cell proliferation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Therapeutic agents must be physically, chemically, and biologically engineered for delivery to the site of action where cell entry, stability, bio-distribution, and clearance contribute to their overall efficacy.&nbsp; Multifunctional delivery systems with targeted therapeutic payloads have been developed and many show promise in clinical use.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;"><span>The path towards comprehensive precision medicine will require the convergence of many fields of science in order to develop new technologies that characterize disease at the personal level and map the underlying causes rather than the physical signs and symptoms.

	Oceans and aquatic ecosystems represent a huge resource that humans have depended on - and overexploited - for centuries. Thus, the ocean environment is not only under enormous and ever-increasing stress, it has changed. The Ocean Tracking Network's (OTN's) premise is that complete understanding of the oceans and their sustainable use can only be achieved through a globally-integrated understanding of ocean conditions and their effects on the animals that inhabit them. Thus the OTN is building an entirely new ocean observation system, one that is centered on measuring marine animal movements, habitat use and survival, in relation to changing ocean conditions, and to inform and advance an international social and legal framework for the oceans. Headquartered at Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, OTN uses sonic and other telemetry technologies (satellite tags, archival data-storage tags) to document movements and survival of marine animals. OTN is creating a global network of acoustic receivers and oceanographic sensors (deployed in all the world's oceans and connecting waters, spanning seven continents), which record animal detections, movements, and interactions, in addition to oceanographic observations; is establishing a global network of users with a common database; and is demonstrating technologies that link animal locations and movements to oceanographic/environmental conditions. A key priority for OTN has been to integrate overarching framework questions, research strategies, cross-cutting activities, and student training across Canada and internationally. To accomplish this, coordinated measurements are being made of oceanographic characteristics and variability at various spatial and temporal scales, movements of key species at various trophic levels, and analysis of key acoustic "bioprobes" (animals that carry tags which record locations visited, ocean conditions and interactions with other tagged animals) and "roboprobes" (remotely controlled gliders that measure ocean conditions and tagged animals) to complement measurements from fixed OTN curtains. Other studies include accelerometers for studying animal growth and energetics; identification of the factors that influence mortality of diadromous and anadramous fish during migrations; development of novel analytical techniques for analysis of animal tracking data; characterizing predator-prey interactions to inform debates on roles of top predators in fish population dynamics; and identification of patterns of seasonal habitat use of marine animals relative to citing of protected areas.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Knowledge of the environment (depth, temperature, oxygen concentration, etc.) experienced by free swimming fishes is important for advancing our understanding of their physiological ecology and habitat preferences. However, these same data could also be useful for improving oceanographic models (e.g., regional and local circulation patterns, upwelling events, etc.). Our research has demonstrated that even &lsquo;coastal&rsquo; sharks make frequent dives between the surface mixed layer and a depth of several hundred meters and thereby repeatedly &lsquo;sample&rsquo; ocean structure.&nbsp;<span> However, obtaining these data in a timely manner (for example, in near real time) and with sufficient precision and geographic accuracy presents significant challenges because these species come to the surface infrequently and/or for short periods of time. This situation is exacerbated in areas with minimal satellite coverage.&nbsp; For instance in Hawaii, Argos satellite coverage is only approximately 20% of any 24 hour period. </span><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">To improve methods for obtaining environmental data from free swimming fishes and to assess the quality and utility of these data, we are tagging sharks in the PacIOOS arena around Oahu, Hawaii. The PacIOOS array has a suite of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; oceanographic sensors that contribute to a data base against which we can compare our animal-derived data and to which, potentially, we can add our own results.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to acquire both the desired environmental data (e.g., temperature, oxygen saturation) and get accurate estimates of the animal&rsquo;s location, we are tagging sharks with combinations acoustic, satellite and pop-off satellite tags.&nbsp; One new avenue of inquiry is whether land based receivers can significantly augment the data being acquired via satellite transmissions.

	Having served as Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State, I see how U.S. science and engineering excellence and leadership is essential for our nation&rsquo;s security (e.g., its economy, defense, health), and how scientific cooperation is an essential tool of U.S. diplomacy and development. International STI research cooperation for the U.S. is a positive national strategy to help leverage scientific expertise, facilities, and funding around the world, to train a globally-engaged U.S. workforce, and to find new research and industrial partners and new markets. A key part of such a national effort is enabling U.S. universities to engage more strategically in international STI collaboration. As a nation we need to improve our ability to translate our vision into well-informed plans for STI research and action. I find that at meetings on complex challenges that require expertise from many sources (e.g., on urbanization, 3-D manufacturing, synthetic biology, water, nanotechnology), many of those I meet are striving to build such visionary capacity that is not so discipline- or institution-bound.&nbsp; As I travel outside the U.S., I learn about ambitious STI aspirations, policies and programs of many other countries. I often stumble across top-notch projects being conducted by U.S. universities and their industry partners in these countries. With little information disseminated more widely about international STI engagement of U.S. universities and companies, it remains difficult for our nation and its institutions to understand our international STI portfolio, to learn from it, and to strengthen and grow it. And I find few ways to communicate to the U.S. STI enterprise the many things that can be uncovered about STI efforts in other nations. I know such insights could help U.S. scientists, universities and industries build strong, productive and sustainable STI partnerships. As a nation we have numerous efforts that seek to explore trends and implications of the rapid advances in STI.&nbsp; Publicly-available reports funded or carried out by the U.S. government attempt to do this, e.g., the Department of Commerce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Deep Dive in Space&rdquo;, the Air Force&rsquo;s &ldquo;Technology Horizons&rdquo;, and the National Research Council&rsquo;s &ldquo;S&amp;T Strategies of Six Countries&rdquo;; such studies perform an essential national function by focusing on how global STI trends might influence national security.&nbsp; Given our distributed, &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; STI R&amp;D enterprise, however, there is little emphasis on disseminating insights from these and other assessment and foresight activities to enable us to engage more strategically around the world, and thereby harness the transformational potential of emerging STI for tremendous social and/or economic benefit for the U.S. and other nations.&nbsp;<b> </b>

	American research universities are undergoing major philosophical and practical changes in their international engagement strategies. It is imperative that we properly prepare our students to be productive members of the rapidly evolving global society. At Lehigh University, for example, internationalism is fundamental to our educational mission. Lehigh has long offered a global education, but we wanted to do more. Our goals and challenges, like those of our peer institutions, revolve around both importing scholars from other nations and cultures to our community and exporting our students to experience global opportunities. My own international work has taken me to Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Central Asia and the Caucasus, the UK, and Japan, among other places; everywhere I go, there is a need and a desire for academic collaboration and international engagement. Universities can be hubs of this kind of global entrepreneurship, but it is a delicate balance sustaining our local communities while also satisfying our global initiatives.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">&nbsp;In 2007, we developed our strategy for &ldquo;Getting to Global Lehigh&rdquo; with the aim of creating a true global culture on campus. We want internationalism to flow not only from formal instruction but also from day-to-day conversations, associations and friendships. This includes providing meaningful international experiences for our students and welcoming more international students and visitors to our university. We provide a menu of programs that allow our students opportunities to study, work, and conduct research abroad. For example, in 2011 a challenge grant from alumnus Lee Iacocca formed the Iacocca International Internships for Global Leadership, which provides students the opportunity to pursue an internship in their area of study in a corporation, university or service organization while immersed in another culture. Lehigh&rsquo;s strengths in Science Technology and Innovation also play a key role in our international strategy. We are extending our leadership in STI through international research and education as the dynamic global STI enterprise continues to change.

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">IEEE Fellow
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Revolutionary inventions often occur in the most unexpected ways. The quest for a solid state, single charge-type MOS transistor initiated in the mid-40s at the Bell Labs led to the discovery of an unexpected bipolar transistor. It took two more decades after this invention until the &ldquo;Silicon Gate Process&rdquo; finally made the MOS transistor a reality. In the subsequent 10 years the modern semiconductor industry became a reality.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The industry continued to expand at &ldquo;double digit&rdquo; growth rates in the 80s until the incubation time necessary to introduce new technological process steps into manufacturing made it clean that an innovative and more systematic long-term approach had become necessary.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The first National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS) was published in 1992; the rate of introduction of new DRAM products occurred every 3 years while Non Volatile Memory (NVM) and Logic products were doubling the number of transistors every 2 years. By 1995 it had become clear that some of the fundamental elements of the &ldquo;Silicon Gate Process&rdquo; were bound to reach their limits in the next decade. By 2005 the thickness of the gate dielectric was going to reach 0.3nm corresponding solely to a monolayer of dielectric!
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">This revelation triggered the formation in 1998 of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) with the participation of Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and the US.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The ITRS predicted that it was necessary to drastically innovate and replace all the elements of the original silicon gate transistor except the silicon substrate wafers!
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Rebuilding the Bell Labs was no longer cost effective or fast enough for this task. A new research organization consisting of clusters of universities named Focus Centers Research Program (FCRP) was created to address these problems. The research results were then transferred to Sematech and IMEC. By 2003 new transistors emerged from the research laboratories of leading semiconductor companies. By 2007, after 10 years of incubation, the new transistor technology (high-k/metal-gate) was into manufacturing.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The lessons learned from this innovative and globally integrated research methodology consisting of ITRS, University, Consortia, Industry Research and Development, and finally High Volume Manufacturing led in 2005 to the formation of the Nanoelectronics Research Initiative (NRI) aimed at new frontier devices capable of replacing the standard CMOS devices by the year 2020!

It was the mode of photography in the United States from that year until about the time of the US Civil War.&nbsp; Daguerreotypes are unique, nonreproducible images of almost unbelievable clarity&mdash; yet in many cases they are deteriorating before our eyes. At the University of Rochester and George Eastman House / International Center of Photography, we are using&nbsp; a range of techniques centered around tools in the University&rsquo;s nanocenter to address the understanding and conservation of these invaluable cultural heritage items.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Scientific advances in the chemistry and physics of nano-scale materials, especially silver and gold, require reconsideration of our material understanding of the daguerreotype and will be a central theme of the talk.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Our research on the daguerreotype image exhibits predominately nanoscale physical properties.&nbsp; As molecular structures approach discrete dimensions of several hundred nanometers and below, elemental surface properties become increasingly dominant and do not conform to the general properties of the bulk material. This paper presents a nanometer scale perspective on the daguerreotype and itshas profound conservation implications.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Micron scale and macro properties of metals have been the basis for commonly held explanations of image formation, tarnish, oxidation, and environmental deterioration. Consequently, daguerreotype restorative treatments and preservation methods, both historically and currently, appear to alter the original structure in the former, and are inadequate for preventing progressive deterioration in the latter.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Taking into account the expanding body of research on the unique physical and optical properties of silver and gold, and to a lesser extent copper and mercury, we apply this recent research to our investigation of the daguerreotype.&nbsp; This paper proposes new insight into the extraordinary bio-receptivity of the daguerreotype surface, the optical effects that occur when gold and silver nanoparticles have dimensions considerably smaller than the wavelength of the visible light spectrum and the step-by-step impact of the image formation on nanoscale material science.

In 2013, COMPASS surveyed the current state of communication training availability for graduate scientists across STEM disciplines, using a mix of interviews and crowd-sourced data. We anticipated, and found, a fragmented landscape with knowledge nodes often poorly connected across disciplines, agencies, and domains - even within the same institution. We have identified that defining a set of core competencies for science communication training will be an essential component in tackling the challenge of how to &ldquo;scale up&rdquo; available capacity. We also identified that there are likely to be multiple pathways toward systemic change, including institution-driven, funder-driven, and student-driven. Change could take place through a combination of all of these mechanisms, with any single pathway able to serve as a catalyst for systemic change. In December 2013, COMPASS convened an NSF-funded workshop to develop a roadmap that articulates what skills need to be taught and how they can be delivered at a scale commensurate with current demand.

New understandings of the science of science communication and the tools of new media are among the necessary topics to address. Yet to judge the success of communication training, we need to be able to assess across the set of ideas and skills. This talk will define core competencies that training should achieve, knowledge and skills that can be measured in useful ways. These competencies include knowledge of the science communication system, understanding of communication and engagement opportunities, specific communication skills, and conceptual understanding of learning science in informal environments.

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Molecular characterization of organic compounds in mass-limited samples embedded in complex matrices remains one of the grand challenges of chemical measurements in cultural heritage science. Amongst these organic compounds, biomolecules derived from plant and animal sources and a wide variety of synthetic molecules have been used to impart color to textiles for thousands of years. Precipitated on colorless inorganic particles of calcium carbonate, alumina, clay or silica, these dyes have been used as pigments in easel paintings, illuminated manuscripts, watercolors, pastels, and a variety of other media, contributing to our artistic patrimony and cultural identity.&nbsp; In the past few years Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) has been demonstrated as a powerful technique for the minimally invasive, ultra-high sensitive detection of both natural and synthetic organic colorants.&nbsp; Dyes have successfully been identified in works of art from samples as small as a few grains (i.e. a few mg) of pigmented material or 25 &mu;m of fiber using surface SERS.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In this talk, we report on the interdisciplinary efforts of a group of scientists at Northwestern University and the Art Institute of Chicago to develop tailored nanostructured substrates, experimental protocols, and most recently, theoretical approaches for dye identification.&nbsp; The identification of colorants in important works of art on paper from America&rsquo;s master watercolorist Winslow Homer (1836-1910) and pastels by American impressionist Mary Cassatt (1844-1926), as well as several examples of analysis of priceless textiles from the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago will be presented.&nbsp; In addition, the underexplored area of infrared surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (NIR-SERS) for analysis of artworks and the use of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) for colorants&rsquo; identification will be presented.

	As federal funding and university budgets come under substantial pressure, and science denialism becomes mainstream, public outreach has become of critical importance. &nbsp;It is an important vehicle for promoting science literacy in the era of anthropogenic global change, and for increasing support for the sciences.&nbsp; Although the need for science outreach and communication is recognized, at present few programs or courses exist to allow young scientists the opportunity to hone and practice their outreach skills.&nbsp; &nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Engage: The Science Speaker Series represents a unique, graduate student-led effort to improve public outreach skills.&nbsp; Founded in 2009, Engage was created by three science graduate students at the University of Washington.&nbsp; The students developed a novel, interdisciplinary curriculum to investigate why science outreach often fails, to improve graduate student communication skills, and to help students create dynamic, public-friendly presentations.&nbsp; The course incorporates elements of story-telling, improvisational arts, and development of analogy, all with a focus on clarity, brevity and accessibility.&nbsp; This course has been offered to graduate students and post-doctoral researchers from a wide variety of sciences since 2010.&nbsp; Students that have participated in the Engage course present their talks at Town Hall Seattle, and have been invited speakers at a number of venues throughout the city.&nbsp; Demand for access to the course continues to grow.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The growing success of Engage illustrates the need for similar programs in graduate level science curricula.&nbsp; We present the impetus for the development of the program, elements of the curriculum covered in the Engage course, and the importance of an interdisciplinary approach.&nbsp; We will also discuss the challenges inherent to a student-led organization, and the need for faculty, departmental, and institutional support of student-led efforts.

	Solid state lighting, 3D image sensing for computer games, and photovoltaics are examples of how photonics is evolving from an insider&acute;s specialty to a main stream business enabler. Thus, a German &bdquo;harnessing light 2.0&ldquo; agenda was commissioned by the federal government early in 2010 with the goal of including industries which had not been part of the photonics community before. Some 300 experts participated in a process which eventually led to &bdquo;photonics research germany&ldquo;, a federal R&amp;D programme that officially was anounced in may 2011. Set up to last 10 years and to spend 1 bn &euro;, it is aiming mainly at industry-led R&amp;D-projects, understanding that industry will add up another 1 bn &euro; for the funded projects, followed by additional investment for taking the R&amp;D results to market. Focussing on joint projects the programme helps to develop and sustain networks which cover the whole value chain. In addition, communication channels adressing financial analysts and young professionals are being built up in order to establish photonics as an important future key technology to be regarded for investment and career choices.
Following the development in several member countries, photonics R&amp;D is becoming an important issue also at the European level under the new R&amp;D supporting scheme to be started in 2014 (&bdquo;horizon 2020&ldquo;). Here, photonics is regarded as one of a few &bdquo;key enabling technologies&ldquo; which will mark scientific and industrial competition frontiers in the years to come.

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Research, in general, could be driven by either pursuing scientific dreams or meeting societal requirements. Compared to other countries in the world and following the similar or even more dramatic economic demands in different areas, such as datacom &amp; telecom, green energy, advanced manufacturing, national security, etc., photonics research in China during the last decade have experienced a fast-growing period that could be characterized as &ldquo;<i>building, catching, specializing and leading</i>&rdquo;. Detailed analyses will be reviewed during the talk with some highlights listed as bellow.

&bull;&nbsp;Building state-of-art infrastructures<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Since last 80&rsquo;s, China has initiated different programs to build up research infrastructures with state-of-art facilities. Up till now, there are three National Labs, about twenty National Key Labs and National Engineering Labs, as well as more than one hundred key labs of ministries and provinces, related to photonics research crossing the whole country.

&bull;&nbsp;Catching cutting-edge topics<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Different hot topics, including nano-, bio-, silicon- and microwave-photonics, 3-D display, photovoltaics, distributed sensor, etc., have been quickly caught by scientists and engineers. These cutting-edge researches are mainly funded by three national programs or resources, i.e. <em>National</em> Basic Research Program (973 program), <em>National</em>High Technology Research and Development Program (863 program) and National Natural Science of China (NSFC).

&bull;&nbsp;Specializing systematic integration<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">&ldquo;<i>Horizontal-style</i>&rdquo; with individual research goals at material, component, module, system and network levels is no longer the major pattern for key projects, while &ldquo;<i>vertical-integration</i>&rdquo; from the bottom (material) to the top (system/network applications) is more encouraged to pursue through team collaborations. Key programs funded by three resources, such as optoelectronic integration, microwave photonics, multi-dimensional transmission, 3-D display, etc., are all following the systematic style. Milestones are more often to be expected under such team integration.

&bull;&nbsp;Leading cost-effective solutions &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Under the pressure of global and national economic development, China has spent lots of efforts on cost-effective solutions through research and development, mainly driven or led by big carriers or suppliers (Huawei, ZTE, Hisense, China Mobile, etc.). These solutions have been widely deployed or used and some of them are regarded as taking the leading roles in the world such as telecomm (metro or long-haul), fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), photovoltaics (solar cells) and so on.

	Over a thousand graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, administrators and lab directors have participated in improvisational theater based sessions led by Dr. Holmes. At conferences, departmental events or short courses, these scientists enter the room with curiosity, skepticism and varying degrees of self-protection. After one to three hours of conversation and games that have participants on their feet, laughing, and creatively completing simple and playful tasks together, they leave having built new relationships with the creative process, with each other, and a new understanding of what scientific culture can be.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Improvisational ensembles willingly go into unknown areas, collaboratively discover next steps, and risk making mistakes together. These traits are increasingly recognized as central components of creative, inclusive organizations, teaching and innovation. Learning to&nbsp;work together as improvisational ensembles that flexibly work with constraints informs participants&rsquo; interactions and their approach to science.&nbsp; From the first workshop at Harvard Medical School&rsquo;s Systems Biology Department and those that followed, scientists were eager for opportunities to build community and stretch their collaborative, creative capacities.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Holmes created improv<b>science</b> to meet the newly identified need. For herself, Holmes discovered the benefits of performance and improvisation through the East Side Institute and All Stars Project, independently funded grassroots organizations focused on community and youth development. Their practice of collective performance and play that re-initiates human development have shaped Holmes approach to building more open, inclusive and innovative scientific communities.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Through her National Science Foundation project Improvisational Theater for Computing Scientists, Holmes met STEM professionals nation-wide who also see collaborative groups (ensembles) as important for creative learning, developing scientists, and communication. These scientists create social contexts in which they, their colleagues, students and staff improvise new scientific, cultural performances. A cross-section of their work is visible in the abstracts of the Cultivating Ensembles in STEM Education and Research (CESTEMER) meeting convened in 2012 at University of Connecticut Health Center. In this talk, Holmes shares the voices and projects of this growing community of STEM professionals and her work as a pioneer of the improv(e) science community that is innovating the performance of science.

	Trique, an indigenous language of Mexico, has an elaborate tone system that distinguishes words using up to nine distinct pitch patterns. Some of the intriguing questions in languages like this are "Exactly how do native speakers tell the different words apart?" and "Are speakers of these languages exceptional in their ability to perceive pitch differences?" Linguistic research on other tone languages, like Chinese or Thai, has found that native listeners of a tone language are better at perceiving pitch than native listeners of non-tonal languages. Here, the opposite was found. Listeners of French, a non-tonal language, were better at discriminating pitch than native Trique listeners. Along with listeners' differing educational backgrounds, differing linguistic and cultural expectations seem to be the cause.

	To what extent does the language we speak influence how we plan our utterances? Eye tracking evidence from Tzeltal, a Mayan language, reveals that the uptake of visual information in pictures of simple events is affected by the word order of the to-be-uttered sentence. This indicates that the time course of sentence formulation may be mediated by language-specific grammatical properties. The freer word order of Tzeltal, as compared with English, allows us to see this difference.

	Scholarly studies are often commissioned by museums and federal agencies in the United States to provide a basis for determining cultural affiliation pursuant to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Cultural affiliation is the historically traceable shared identity between a present-day Indian tribe and an earlier identifiable group. The determination of cultural affiliation requires examination of scientific, historical and traditional information, and government-to-government consultation with Indian tribes. In addition to documenting significant information about human remains and cultural items subject to repatriation, NAGPRA research and consultation create an opportunity for dialogue between&nbsp;anthropologists and Indian tribes. This dialogue can act as a springboard that leads to productive collaboration on other research projects. In this presentation, I discuss several recent NAGPRA studies that led to academic research that transcended repatriation issues and produced significant new knowledge.

	The repatriation of human remains is often presented as a simple dichotomy between scientists and the claimant communities in which no common ground can possibly exist. It is however possible, with goodwill on both sides, to understand the values and viewpoints of the other. The Natural History Museum has over the past decade adopted more constructive approaches when meeting with and supporting claimant communities which strives to combine respect for their needs and beliefs while still engaging in discussion about the importance of ancestral human remains to science. This approach necessitated several changes in our traditional way of working in this area, including a requirement to be open in our dealings with indigenous communities, sharing findings, and being prepared to leave the &lsquo;ivory tower&rsquo; of the institution and meet with claimant communities on their home territory. We feel, and evidence shows that these initiatives are beginning to break down barriers and enable the scientists at the NHM and the communities to see each other as fellow human beings and cultural allies rather than political adversaries. Our experiences with communities have been many and varied. Our first repatriation, to Tasmania, was a difficult experience but our discussions with the community revealed a mismatch between expectations and understanding.&nbsp; This has formed the basis for a new way forward for the museum. The repatriation of ancestral remains to Torres Strait was the first using our new methods and has allowed an exchange of ideas and understanding to be made which has culminated in the community deciding to leave ancestral Torres Strait remains in trust with the NHM for molecular analysis. This would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. Our most recent return was to Hawaii, this was a different experience as there is an expectation in the community that remains will be reburied immediately upon return. However, our long discussions, through meetings and conference calls allowed the community and the museum to move from being adversaries to collaborators, working to ensure that remains of doubtful provenance were correctly identified. Our current claim is from a group of communities in South Australia and we have and are working with these communities and their representatives to share our knowledge with each other and provide a greater understanding of the value and importance of these ancestral remains to all parties. Working with communities is allowing the emphasis to shift from conflict to mutual understanding and the realisation that both researchers and communities have a shared interest, respect and veneration of the remains.

	Agricultural genetics is currently being revolutionized by technological developments in genomic and statistical research. High-throughput genotyping technology delivers hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism markers and has become available for many crop and livestock species. The technological feasibility of obtaining full genome sequences at reasonable costs for a large number of individuals is within striking distance. Thus, genetic analysis of quantitatively inherited traits and prediction of the genetic predisposition of individuals based on molecular data are rapidly evolving fields of research in agricultural genetics.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">This talk presents quantitative genetic approaches that make it possible to extract knowledge on the genetic value of individual plants or animals from high-dimensional genomic data and to predict the genetic makeup of individual offspring. Statistical methods for prediction of genetic values and phenotypes from genome-wide molecular marker data will be introduced, and challenges arising from the large number of predictors and their high degree of collinearity will be addressed.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The efficiency of genome-enabled prediction will be demonstrated with experimental studies on grain yield and insect resistance in maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.). Estimates of prediction accuracies achieved in these studies are encouraging with respect to the usefulness of genome-enabled prediction in practical breeding programs. On this basis, optimum scenarios for exploiting knowledge from high-dimensional molecular data in breeding schemes will be discussed.

	Fifty years after the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay the founding documents for the establishment of the British Province of South Australia (1834) promised a just settlement for the original Indigenous habitants and their descendants. Those original commitments were not honoured and South Australia looks today very much like the other Australian States; land taken without consent, without a treaty and where the pre-existing sovereignty of Indigenous peoples was ignored by the South Australian Company in its executive action to establish the Province of South Australia. This presentation considers the original promises made in the Letters Patent in the context of contemporary moves by Ngarrindjeri people to seek repatriation of ancestors stolen from burial grounds on Ngarrindjeri lands.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Indigenous campaigns for the return of human remains have been a significant instrument of change in professional practice in museums and other cultural institutions including universities over the past thirty years.&nbsp; Repatriation, however, remains a contentious and often traumatic issue for communities, museums, universities and governments as a result of the continued retention of Indigenous human remains.&nbsp; In 2008 preliminary discussions were held between representatives of the Ngarrindjeri nation and the Natural History Museum London about the repatriation of Ngarrindjeri Old people&rsquo;s (human) remains held in the collections of the NHM. The Ngarrindjeri want to build on this earlier discussion with the NHM for the return of the Old people from a position which recognises and enacts the promises made by the early British colonists.&nbsp; The sovereign position taken by the Ngarrindjeri nation, through the negotiation of contract agreements with the South Australian Government on other issues, paves the way to rethink repatriation as a process of renewal. Renewal that moves beyond neoliberal biopolitical &lsquo;solutions&rsquo; of human remains access management to acknowledgment of a wrong, the resetting of boundaries on the exercise of power and as a collaborative effort to interrupt colonialisms continuities.

	The seeds of maize and other cereal grasses are the main source of calories on<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">earth, mainly due to their high carbohydrate content (reaching about 80%). Not<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">surprisingly, such a concentration of starch has resulted in industrial applications,<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">even if energy output characteristics do not rival conventional fuels. Such<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">applications threaten to strangle food supplies in places where there are no<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">alternatives. At the same time it is important to recognize that cereal seeds have<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">critical shortcomings even in their traditional uses as food and feed: Humans and<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">livestock cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need from those calories<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">and therefore need to supplement those in their diet. Lack of essential amino<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">acids in the diet can lead to severe, even life-threatening conditions.<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Food or feed does not provide these essential amino acids in free form, but in the<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">form of proteins that upon digestion are released into the blood stream.<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Therefore, the composition of seed proteins presents a critical bottleneck in the<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">world's food supply. Fortuitously, this is precisely where genomics offers critical<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">insights with practical potential. In cereals, the seed proteins &ndash; whose amino acid<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">composition determines the nutritional quality of food and feed &ndash; are dominated<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">by small gene families that are highly expressed. The genes encoding them have<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">evolved through gene amplification in tandem and by dispersal throughout the<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">genome. Comparative analysis of whole-genome sequences of a number of<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">species of the grass gene family can now be used to re-trace gene copies and<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">their divergence in structure during speciation. Their divergence explains, for<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">example, why seed proteins of some cereals are more suitable for making bread<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">and noodles than others but also can trigger autoimmune diseases in certain<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">human haplotypes.

	Maize, like many crops, is extremely diverse, especially when compared to mammalian diversity.&amp;nbsp; In the case of maize, that diversity is the product of evolution and adaptation over the last several million years.&amp;nbsp; There are more than 100 million common genetic variations distributed across the maize genome, which makes any two maize varieties likely to be far more different genetically than humans and chimps are from one another.&amp;nbsp; This tremendous natural diversity has already allowed maize to respond to selection in a multitude of ways, and provides the potential for creating a more sustainable crop that satisfies some of the desperate nutritional needs facing many parts of the world. Future improvement of maize will be greatly accelerated through genomics. &amp;nbsp;However, until recently, the tools of genomics could only be applied to a few maize varieties, due to the high cost and the labor involved. But this has all changed in the last few years. &amp;nbsp;We have developed major technological and analytical advances that allow the diverse genomes of maize to be sequenced and profiled exponentially faster and more effectively than before.&amp;nbsp; This process has now identified more than one thousand genes controlling the adaption &lt;a href="#_msocom_1"&gt;[R1]&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of maize to diverse environmental circumstances, and to modern agricultural practices.&amp;nbsp; Through extensive field testing across the globe, genetic variants controlling nutritional value and adaptation to different environments are being identified.&amp;nbsp; These new techniques allow us to tap the natural diversity of landraces (historical farm varieties), permitting identification and efficient utilization of a tremendous range of existing adaptations.&amp;nbsp; As a result, breeders are now more effectively harnessing the natural diversity of maize to improve vitamin A content, acid soil tolerance, drought tolerance, nitrogen use efficiency, and disease resistance. Although the basic road map for analyzing the genome for useful adaptations is now in place, the journey to link the majority of the millions of functional gene variants to individual traits has only just begun.&amp;nbsp; This journey will be greatly hastened by the effective integration of a wide assortment of powerful new technologies.&amp;nbsp; Over the next several years, a key issue will be how to best harness the tools of breeding, engineering, and computer science to collect and analyze vast quantities of phenotypic data from around the globe. &amp;nbsp;We have the tools, and now scientists, farmers, and the public need to consider how we can best work together to achieve the most sustainable agriculture possible.

	Each year, nations around the world make significant investments in Earth observations for civil use. Information produced with these observations informs decisions about the well-being of the citizens and the environment. The United States domestic policy on national civil Earth observations centers on the principle that the data acquired from these observing systems is a public good. It promotes open and timely sharing of civil Earth observations, making them freely available for use in a wide range of sectors, in order to promote economic growth based on the development of value added products and services through technological and scientific innovation.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The principles of open access, data sharing, and increased data accessibility are gaining traction among a growing number of nations. The collaboration on promoting these principles globally is coordinated through the intergovernmental Group on Earth Observations (GEO). Formally established in 2005, GEO is a coalition of 90 willing governments and 67 participating organizations that aims to build a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) to realize its vision of a &ldquo;future wherein decisions and actions for the benefit of humankind are informed by coordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth observations and information&rdquo;.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In reaching its vision, GEO takes a value-chain approach &ndash; from identifying observation requirements for specific end-user needs, obtaining and coordinating access to those observations, catalyzing end-user applications and delivering them to the intended users ready to be applied in end-use processes, and driving societal benefits across a multitude of disciplines. In its first 10 years, GEO has facilitated free and open access to over one million data sets that can be searched and discovered through an information system that connects to existing and developing data and information sources through a common use of metadata standards, protocols and interoperability arrangements. These interoperability and interconnectivity practices extend access to individual data collections beyond their originally intended user communities. Through establishing and expanding Communities of Practice, GEO bridges stakeholders from scientific, technological and policy-making communities to brainstorm, develop, prototype and launch solutions to shared challenges.

	The need for a coordinated effort managing risks stemming from Natural Hazards is evident from the staggering figures. For instance, in Europe, the volcanic ash cloud crisis, from 15 to 21 April 2010, led to the cancelation of 100.000 flights in Europe (54% of total flights), with an impact on the world economy of approximately &euro;3 billion. It is estimated that ten million passengers were blocked at airports during a period of six days.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Agence France Presse has reported that, overall in 2010, disaster events caused the death of almost 300000 people, affected another 220 million and resulted in more than $120 billion of economic damages. While 2011 saw a drop in fatalities, the economic damages tripled to over $366 billion. The Japanese earthquake and tsunami of March 2011 alone accounted for over half of these damages. By 2050, the number of people exposed to storms and earthquakes in large cities could double, underlining the need for better geohazards related information for improved Disaster Risk Management (DRM).
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Earth Observations (EO) of geologically active sites prone to natural hazards, has a major role to play in contributing to the understanding, mitigation, preparedness and management of geophysical risks.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The International Charter on 'Space and Major Disasters', a body comprising all major agencies operating space EO infrastructures, commits resources for activating quick responses the disaster areas, and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) managed by the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) provides access to a number of existing and emerging services, data sets, and products in support of all phases of the risk management cycle (mitigation, preparedness, early warning, response and recovery).
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">A major contribution is the provision of relevant EO data to scientists who can use the observations to develop a better understanding of the underlying processes with the aim to better inform risk management. Scientists benefit from improved data availability and in return can support the development of GEOSS so that it meets their needs. In particular the GEO Supersites initiative, which provides focussed observations on areas prone for natural hazards, makes a major contribution towards an effective natural DRM.&nbsp; EO data of solid Earth dynamic processes controlling natural phenomena will be made immediately available promoting their comparison with numerical simulations and their interpretation through theoretical analyses which will foster scientific excellence in solid Earth research.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The presentation will give examples of how international efforts like GEO are fostering the improvement of natural DRM through integrating spaceborne and in-situ EO data.

	The political, societal, scientific and medical response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the last ten years has shaped the landscape of the next era of global health. At the centre of an effective response is that it is evidence-based and targets the specific environment and the needs of the most affected and in a given country context. In many countries across the world, this has resulted in tensions between the cultural, legal and policy environment and the urgent need to address vulnerable and marginalized populations. Harm reduction (HR) interventions, for example, have been proven to be effective in preventing infection with HIV in people who inject drugs and is recommended by WHO. Yet, only 50 % of countries in the world support HR in national policy documents and or through implementation of interventions. The history of acceptance, rejection or partial recognition of HR illustrates the tensions between science and policy-making and between scientific evidence and relativist stances of political nature. Drafting global guidelines and recommendations based on a critical review of evidence, on broad consultations and consensus-seeking processes, and establishing new multi-sectoral partnerships and dialogue between the civil society and public sector, are among the tools that science diplomacy has successfully used to remove some of the societal/political barriers to access to care and that this presentation will discuss.

	Science, communicated well, provides a critical opportunity for stakeholders involved in global health policy development to engage and break down barriers. Policy development in e.g. pharmaceutical, tobacco and food regulation often lack a robust science base, which leads to politically driven rather than evidence-based policy. By widely sharing our biomedical discoveries, cultivating research talent and human resources in developing countries, and negotiating treaties and other international agreements that save lives and improve health, we can provide leadership through science and foster more constructive relations with other countries. Both the United Nations High Level Meeting Political Declaration and WHO Global Action Plan on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases call for multi-stakeholder action and evidence-based policies. Sound global health policy will greatly benefit if we can generate new ideas to show the positive role science and scientists can play in the design and development of policies to ensure the highest possible standards of health, wealth and stability of the world.

	AMAP was initiated in 1991 by Ministers from the eight Arctic countries and was tasked to monitor and assess the pollution of the Arctic, including effects of climate change on Arctic ecosystems and humans. In the following decade several international and regional initiatives where established to handle the new situation in the Arctic after the end of the cold war. Several of these initiatives had overlapping focus and priority areas, e.g. to assist the transition in Russia. The opening of the Arctic sea in the summer due to melt of sea ice has increased possibilities for cross Arctic shipping and increased resource extraction from the Arctic. This situation has led to a new interest for the Arctic. Over the last years several countries in Asia and Europe has asked to be observer to the Arctic Council and to take part in the work performed by the Arctic Councils working groups.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Since 1993 AMAP has delivered more than 30 scientific and technical assessments. This work has mainly been performed by experts from the eight Arctic countries and the arctic indigenous peoples, but also experts nominated by the observing countries and organizations to the Arctic Council and AMAP. Involvement of international organizations has been extremely important for this work to secure cost efficiency, to avoid duplication of work and to get access to relevant data and information. However, the involvement of all these experts and organizations has been an interesting challenge due to different cultures and interests.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The results from AMAP&rsquo;s assessments have played a significant role in the establishment of international protocols and conventions, and to provide food advice to Arctic indigenous peoples.

Yet, epidemics of smoking, obesity and similar behaviors can change rapidly suggesting extreme environmental modification of genetic risks. Current models include assessment of broad social environmental factors and their modification of genetic predisposition. &nbsp;Recent findings that provide important clues about gene-environment interactions include studies which show that family-based prevention interventions may be particularly effective in a subset of adolescents at increased genetic risk for onset of substance abuse (Brody G, et al. 2009).&nbsp; &nbsp;Other studies show intriguing interactions of genotype with responses to tobacco taxation policies (Fletcher JM, 2012), and family genetic studies suggest important interactions of genetic and environmental risk factors (Kendler K, et al. 2012).&nbsp; Furthermore, understanding of epigenetics may provide insights into mechanisms of the impact of genetic variation on response to environment. Studies such as the Gene-Environment-Development-Initiative (GEDI) at NIDA show great promise in unraveling these complex diseases and pointing the way toward effective prevention and treatment.

	Obesity and overweight together are the second leading cause of preventable death in the US and a major cause of premature death in all developed, and increasingly developing, countries. Global science is only beginning to understand why variation in our genetic material can increase our vulnerability to develop food dependence and become obese. Recent clinical and preclinical findings have shed important new light on the mechanisms by which genetic variation can increase vulnerability to gain weight. They evidence the fundamental importance of better understanding gene and environment interactions. In this presentation, I will discuss new findings made in conjunction with teams of global researchers on the genetics of obesity. In particular, I will show how genetic variation in the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) can increase vulnerability to develop compulsive eating and gain weight. I will also explain how D2R variation interacts with so-called "obesogenic" environments to control risk of weight gain. Together, these findings will highlight the important contribution that our genes make to vulnerability to weight gain, while equally evidencing how many of the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.

	Placed in the context of international efforts to reduce the harm caused by smoking classic cigarettes and an ever-increasing range of nicotine-based products, this presentation will place under the microscope the principal reinforcing component responsible for addiction - nicotine. A much maligned substance, nicotine gets the blame for the harm caused by smoking. Yet scientifically speaking, nicotine is a relatively innocuous substance. Medical products containing purified nicotine, for example, are not associated with adverse health effects. Neither are people becoming addicted to nicotine replacement therapies like patches, gums or nasal sprays. In this presentation, I will examine what recent clinical and preclinical findings are telling us about variations in our genetic material that can increase our vulnerability to develop nicotine dependence. In particular, I will focus on what the behavioral, molecular and biochemical evidence is telling us about the brain's regulation of the aversive properties of nicotine on one hand, and increases in vulnerability to nicotine dependence on the other.

	Research has traditionally been conducted by a single scientist or a small team of scientists within a single laboratory. The scientist(s) would conduct the majority of required experiments themselves, even if they did not initially have the necessary expertise or equipment. If they could not conduct an experiment themselves, they would attempt to find a collaborator to help them by using a barter system. This barter system involves one scientist asking for a favor from another, with the potential upside being co-authorship on any publications that are produced by the work. This type of collaborative arrangement depends heavily on personal networks developed by scientists.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">As research has become increasingly specialized and complex, this DIY/barter system has ceased to function effectively. It is no longer possible for a single scientist to master all the techniques or purchase all the equipment required to conduct their experiments, and they cannot maintain sufficient personal networks to enable effective bartering for all of the complex experiments required. Frequently, an entire university cannot provide all the expertise necessary for a research project, <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/sti_scoreboard-2009-en/04/03/index.html?contentType=&itemId=/content/chapter/sti_scoreboard-2009-47-en&containerItemId=/content/serial/20725345&accessItemIds=/content/book/sti_scoreboard-2009-en&mimeType=text/html">over 60% of papers are now co-authored by investigators from multiple institutions</a>.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The amount of collaboration required in research will continue to increase, driven by many factors including increased specialization, more complex and large scale instrumentation, and an increasing desire to obtain cross-fertilization across disciplines. With large teams of scientists, often based at remote institutions, increasingly needing to work together to solve complex problems, there will be a demand for new tools to help facilitate collaboration. Specifically, there will be an increasing need for tools that allow researchers to easily find and access other scientists with the expertise required to advance their research projects. To operate most efficiently these tools also need new methods to reward researchers for participating in these collaborations.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The digital marketplace model provides a mechanism for researchers to list their expertise so that other researchers can easily find them and request collaborations. Several sites that allow for scientific networking exist including <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGate</a>, and <a href="http://www.biomedexperts.com/">BiomedExperts</a>, but these are not specifically designed to facilitate formal transactions between scientists.&nbsp;<a href="file:///C:/Users/T/Dropbox/science%20exchange/scienceexchange.com">ScienceExchange</a>&nbsp;serves less of a social networking and discussion function, and instead offers a fee-for-service marketplace, delineating a clear incentive for experts to participate in collaborations that they may not have been interested in previously.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Although serendipity in human interactions across many domains can be wonderful and fruitful, there is a downside to relying exclusively on chance bringing the right scientists together at the right time. By formalizing and democratizing access to scientific collaboration, the internet age will be a&nbsp;powerful force in improving the speed and quality of scientific research.

	It is widely accepted that the Arctic Ocean will lose most of its perennial sea ice cover sometime within this century, and perhaps as soon as the decade 2030-2040. Uncertainty as to when a seasonally-ice free state will be reached reflects the unknown future rates of greenhouse gas emissions, the large scatter in projections between different climate models, even when driven with the same scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, and natural climate variability.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is highly likely, however, that the basic trajectory towards a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean will follow the pattern that has been observed over the period of satellite observations, namely, an overall downward trend in ice extent with superimposed year to year fluctuation as well as multi-year periods of both rapid ice loss and temporary recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the (then) record low ice extent observed for September of 2007 was followed by successively higher September ice extents in 2008 and 2009, only to be followed by lower extents in 2010, 2011 and then a plunge to a new record low in 2012.&nbsp; September of 2013 in turn saw a substantial recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; This uneven pattern of sea ice decline reflects the natural variability in ocean conditions and weather patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very low ice extent seen in 2007 was driven in part by an atmospheric pattern in summer favoring high Arctic temperatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strong recovery in 2013 is consistent with a relatively cool and stormy weather pattern that limited summer melt. &nbsp;It also appears that as the ice cover has thinned, it has become more vulnerable to disruption by extreme weather events.&nbsp; For example, the very strong storm over the central Arctic Ocean observed in July of 2012 appears to have accentuated summer ice loss, contributing to the record low extent observed that year. The role of ocean circulation changes remains incompletely resolved.&nbsp; While there is ample evidence of increased transport of warm Atlantic-derived waters into the Arctic Ocean, this warm water is found at depth and it is unclear whether much of this extra heat can be brought to the surface to impact the ice cover.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Other studies point to a role of warmer Pacific waters entering the Arctic Ocean via Bering Strait.&nbsp; While there has been considerable speculation over the existence of a &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo;, which, once crossed, will be followed by a very rapid transition to a seasonally ice free state, recent work argues against this extreme scenario.

	Despite the recovery of summer sea ice extent in 2013 relative to the record minimum in 2012 (5.1 versus 3.4 M km2), sea ice loss remains a major indicator of global change.&nbsp; 2013 is still the 6<sup>th</sup> lowest sea ice extent and it well known that that one should consider the contributions of natural variability in weather patterns and ocean conditions in addition to long term downward trends. Better indices of change are sea ice thickness, the amount of old multiyear sea ice, and thus sea ice volume that has decreased by 75% since 1980.&nbsp; Recovery of multi-year, thick, old sea ice would be particularly difficult, thus preventing Arctic climate from returning to the state of a decade or more ago. Further, observations and physical understanding support the conclusion that most global climate model results in the recent IPCC 5<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report archive are too conservative in their sea ice projections of summer sea ice loss of 2050 and beyond. Time horizons for a nearly sea ice-free summer from data extrapolation and physical understanding suggest a summer sea ice loss roughly 2020 to 2030. Major sea ice loss is already occurring north of Alaska. In contrast to model results, data suggest an immediacy to climate change adaptation for the Arctic over the next few decades. Mitigation efforts are necessary to reduce the impact of temperature increases in the second half of the century.

	In this presentation, I will build on analysis presented in Francis and Vavrus (GRL, 2012) in which mechanisms were proposed and demonstrated that link enhanced warming in the Arctic during recent decades -- Arctic amplification -- with changes in the trajectory of the upper-level flow in mid-latitudes. Evidence will be presented that suggests Arctic Amplification may have contributed to an increase in large-scale wave amplitude and slower zonal winds in the upper-level flow, both of which favor more persistent weather patterns in mid-latitudes. Prolonged weather conditions are often associated with extreme weather -- such as droughts, cold spells, heat waves, and some flooding events -- some of which appear to be increasing in frequency. New analysis of fields from reanalyses and model output that further supports linkages between Arctic amplification and mid-latitude weather patterns.

Thus, its uptake in a particular community or in a specific given situation is always an issue to be dwelt upon. Therefore, there is a continuous need to innovate technology which is scalable so that it has much wider and universal application.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Tribes or indigenous or natives live in a society which is different from ours, thus they may have a different need. How do we then define technology uptake in tribal areas of India or across the world ? Many technology initiatives undertaken without considering human behaviour, awareness level and the value system resulted in failures and conflicts. We will discuss in this case study problems encountered and challenges faced in innovating and introducing need based appropriate technology. We developed a model of participatory approach between the community and the technologist. Potable water is one of the most essential yet scarce commodity around which life of a tribal women revolves. Ill-effects of non-availability of potable water on their health and economy are huge and we will discuss one such case study. Our innovative model of &ldquo;bottom of the pyramid participatory approach i.e., explore, innovate and generate awareness at the grass root community level is basically to emphasize the benefits of need based assistive device or essential health and water technologies on their living. Providing safe water and essential health technologies may bring about a radical change in the quality of life of vast majority of people across the globe. In our community based technology development program, we focus on the integrated development of tribal women, as they are the nodal agent for change and prosperity, being the epicentre of vital activities such as water, health care, nutrition, energy and agro-based economic output. &nbsp;

	Warming in the mid-latitudes will have an impact on both plants and animals. There are two impacts of temperature which affect all biological systems. First, increasing temperature in plants causes more rapid plant development and more rapid senescence of the plant causing a smaller plant with less grain or fruit. Temperature increases also impact fruit production because the warmer winter temperatures may prevent trees from being exposed to sufficient chilling to enable flowering and fruit set. &nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the temperature also increases the atmospheric demand for water leading to an increase in water use rates by crops and when coupled with more variable precipitation can lead to increased amounts of water stress and reduced productivity. Each plant species has a unique range of temperature at which it grows and exposure to temperatures outside of that range will limit growth. Increases in temperature effects on both plants and animal are often noticed more in the nighttime (minimum) temperature than the daytime (maximum) temperature. &nbsp;Exposure to warm nights disrupts the metabolic processes and creates stress levels affecting the physiological functions in the plant or animal. One of the critical developmental stages for crops is the pollination stage and occurrences of extreme temperature events can reduce pollen viability Exposure to temperatures outside of the normal range of animals causes metabolic disruption leading to decreased productivity of eggs, meat, or milk. Precipitation is the source of water for agriculture and variation in precipitation amounts directly impacts the amount available for use in agricultural systems. &nbsp;With increasing variability in the climate there will be increasing variation and uncertainty in food production leading to increased variation in prices. To overcome the uncertainty in climate, adaptive management strategies for both crops and livestock will have to be implemented.

	The use of large scale solitary confinement became common with the rise of the modern penitentiary during the first half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and has remained a feature of Western prison systems. A central feature of the new prisons was a belief in the ability to rehabilitate criminals through the use of isolation regimes. In Pennsylvania-model institutions prisoners spent almost all their time in the cell. Here the inmate was supposed to turn his thoughts inward, to meet God, to repent his crimes and eventually to return to society as a morally cleansed Christian citizen. Pennsylvania-model prisons experienced extensive problems with inmate mental health throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century but the use of large scale solitary confinement according to this model continued well into the 20<sup>th</sup>century in Holland, Belgium, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The debate about the effects of solitary confinement was largely settled in the 19<sup>th</sup> century in the United States and early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century in Europe, when both experts and practitioners tended to agree that solitary confinement was very harmful. Discussions on the effects of solitary confinement resurfaced in the 1950s when sensory deprivation studies were carried out in response to, among other things, stories about brainwashing of United States prisoners of war in Korea. This caught the interest of intelligence services: the CIA&rsquo;s manual on <i>Counterintelligence interrogation </i>from 1963, for example, described how solitary confinement could be used coercively. During the 1980s, the debate on solitary confinement resurfaced in the wake of the creation of supermax prisons in the United States. According to estimates, more than 80,000 prisoners are currently held in solitary confinement or restricted housing across the US.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Notwithstanding the United States experience, isolation regimes have also been used, debated, and researched extensively elsewhere in the West. Solitary confinement has, for example, been an integral part of Scandinavian pre-trial prison practice for many years. In Denmark this practice was introduced in 1846 for all remand prisoners but became disputed and gave rise to research on the effects of solitary confinement from the late 1970s onwards. In Sweden today around half of all remand prisoners are still subjected to pre-trial solitary confinement, including children who find themselves in pre-trial detention.

Currently there is no way of checking the status of a container which is among a stack of other containers on board a cargo vessel. Today&rsquo;s electronic container monitoring solutions are realised over add-ons requiring a direct GSM connection or a satellite link. Future concepts might see containers made of composite materials with integrated security and communication features, and containers using each other as multi-hop communications forwarder to allow continued monitoring also during transport on cargo vessels. Remote container monitoring will add to the picture: statistical outlier analysis has proven to be a good tool to identify suspicious containers by looking at their stopover times, their itineraries and their transhipments. These methods will be improved in the future to move from a reactive model (analysing existing data) to a pro-active model (making predictions) for container risk assessment. Combining communication between containers with information retrieved from container tracking has the potential to create a whole domain of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; of 20 million cargo containers being shipped worldwide.</i>

	With the rapidly growing popularity of the Intuitive Surgical da Vinci system, robotic minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has crossed the threshold from the laboratory to the real world. There are now hundreds of thousands of human-guided robotic surgeries performed every year, and the number is growing rapidly. This is a unique example of the larger paradigm of human-machine collaborative systems &ndash; namely systems of robots collaborating with people to perform tasks that neither can perform as effectively alone.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In this talk, I will describe our work toward developing effective human-machine collaborative teams. &nbsp;Our research largely focuses on two inter-related problems: 1) recognizing and responding to the intent of the user and 2) evaluating the effectiveness of their performance. We consider surgery to be composed of a set of identifiable tasks which themselves are composed of a small set of reusable motion units that we call "surgemes." By creating models of this "Language of Surgery," we are able to evaluate the style and efficiency of surgical motion. These models also lead naturally to methods for effective training of RMIS using automatically learned models of expertise, and toward methods for supporting or even automating component actions in surgery. I will close by briefly describing our aspirations for this work through a recently funded National Robotics Initiative consortium.

	Returning astronauts have experienced altered immune function and increased vulnerability to infection during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab suggesting that immune-suppression is a major barrier to safe, long-term human space habitation and travel.&nbsp; After review of three decades of International studies on the immune system, there is no doubt that spaceflight changes T cell activation. &nbsp;Here we present past studies and now offer definitive evidence that early signal transduction events are inhibited by the microgravity (ug) environment of spaceflight.&nbsp; Human leukocytes were stimulated with T cell mitogens onboard the International Space Station using a 1g centrifuge as the Earth&rsquo;s 1g control.&nbsp; Microarray analysis demonstrated significant (p&lt; .05) differential expression of 54 genes in ug vs 1g conditions.&nbsp; Fifty percent of the genes most significantly inhibited in ug as compared to 1g showed marked over-representation of NFKB binding sites in their promoter regions. Qtpcr confirmed that upregulation of key genes in the NFKB pathway were inhibited in ug. Inhibition of the NFKB pathway leads to activation dysfunction during spaceflight.&nbsp; Lack of immune response in microgravity occurs at the cellular level. Morover, we have found that decreased immune function in spaceflight in many ways parallel those of aging. &nbsp;In our upcoming spaceflight studies of early T cell activation on International Space Station, we will investigate the earliest expression of mRNAs, miRNAs and proteins in both man and mouse require gravity for appropriate T cell activation. These new ISS experiments will determine if gravity regulates T-cell activation by several different mechanisms.

	Emerging science and technology (S&amp;T) developments continue to influence almost every aspect of the American society. As an example, products involving nanotechnology are both relevant to policy goals as well as to the health and safety of the American public. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent and non-partisan agency working for the U.S. Congress, provides expertise in analyzing such complex S&amp;T issues by making them more accessible and presentable to inform and improve policy making.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">After the closing of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1995, Congress directed GAO to conduct a technology assessment (TA) pilot program. Between 2002 and 2006, GAO completed four TA reports. To illustrate the results of a report, GAO found that though biometrics technologies could be used to secure the border, it had limitations in fingerprinting and facial recognition systems. An immediate impact of the report was a congressional testimony on the use of biometrics which, in turn, helped to inform U.S. national security reform efforts. GAO reports, which are made available to the public, have become essential vehicles for understanding S&amp;T implications of policies considered by the Congress.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Since 2007, Congress has established a permanent TA function within GAO. This new operational role augments GAO&rsquo;s performance audits related to S&amp;T issues, including effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. Federal programs. In the last three years, GAO has completed TA reports on three topics &ndash; rail security, climate engineering, and alternate neutron detectors. As an example of one such report, Congress requested GAO to examine three areas: the current S&amp;T state of climate engineering, views of experts on the future of climate engineering research, and potential public responses to climate engineering. When GAO receives a request to conduct TA, it utilizes existing processes in five phases, which include selecting the topic and initiating the TA plan (i.e., Acceptance phase 1 and Planning phase 2), then conducting TA (i.e., Data Gathering and Analysis phase 3), followed by developing the report and ensuring its accuracy and integrity (i.e., Product Development and Distribution phase 4), and finally receiving feedback from Congress and developing lessons learned to enhance the TA process (i.e., Results phase 5).
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">As the TA program is maturing, GAO is looking ahead to three next steps. First, while GAO has utilized the quality assurance process for conducting performance audits, it is also tailoring the quality assurance framework specifically for conducting technology assessments. Second, in order to support GAO analysts for efficient and effective work, it is developing a guidance document addressing the logic and design of technology assessments. Third, as GAO is interested in measuring the impact of its TA reports, there are plans to develop metrics for impact which will help to identify ways to improve the quality and efficacy of TA.

	An ice core drilled to bedrock (448.12 m) in 2010 on the Bruce Plateau (BP) ice field (66.03&deg;S; 64.07&deg;W; 1975.5 masl) in the northern Antarctic Peninsula (AP) is the second ice core to reach bedrock in the AP and thereby capture the entire preserved record. The few multi-century ice core records from the AP extend back at most 500 years. The annual mass accumulation on the BP is high (~1.8 m w.e. from 1900 to 2009) facilitating precise dating by layer counting back to 1400 CE. &nbsp;Assisted by known volcanic eruptions the annually resolved history is extended back to 1250 CE.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Annually resolved records of stable isotopic content (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O and &delta;D) and mass accumulation provide proxy-based histories of temperature and precipitation. Comparisons with regional meteorological observations indicate that the BP &delta;<sup>18</sup>O record provides a reliable proxy of mean annual air temperature along the west side of the AP.&nbsp; The resulting &delta;<sup>18</sup>O-inferred air temperatures for the last 600 years reveal multi-decadal scale variability with warm conditions during some periods exceeding that of the last few decades. Extracting the annual accumulation history is complicated by layer thinning at depth. &nbsp;A Dansgaard-Johnsen model configured for flank flow is used to reconstruct annual layer thicknesses. The resulting record indicates that average annual mass accumulation (precipitation) rises from ~1400 to ~1800 CE (~2.3 m w.e.) and thereafter declines to a minimum (~1.5 m w.e.) around 1950 CE. Accumulation then rises rapidly to its maximum value (~2.6 m w.e.), consistent with recent accumulation increases in several other ice core-derived accumulation records in the AP.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The Antarctic Peninsula is characterized by a sharp west to east gradient in both atmospheric and oceanographic conditions that create a marked trans-Peninsula contrast in precipitation and to a lesser extent in winter temperature.&nbsp; Thus comparison with the James Ross Island (JRI) ice core drilled to bedrock in 2008 by British scientists offers a unique opportunity to examine the history of regional climate conditions, including the Antarctic Dipole that influences interannual climate variability in the AP.&nbsp; For example, ENSO brings warmer anomalies to the western side and colder anomalies to the eastern side of the AP.&nbsp; These regional (west to east) climate differences are further emphasized by the virtual absence of surface melting at the BP site that is concomitant with a recent acceleration of snow melt as recorded in the JRI core.

	The climate-driven collapse of the Larsen A and B ice shelves has opened up new regions of the coastal Antarctic to the influence of sea ice resulting in increases in seasonal primary production. In this study, passive microwave remote sensing of sea ice concentration and satellite imagery of ocean color are employed to quantify the magnitude of and variability in open water area and net primary production (NPP) in the Larsen embayments between 1997 and 2011. Numerical model output provides context to analyze atmospheric forcing on the coastal ocean. Following ice shelf disintegration the embayments function as coastal, sensible heat polynyas. The Larsen A and B are as productive as other Antarctic shelf regions, with seasonally-averaged daily NPP rates reaching 1232 and 1127 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> and annual rates reaching 200 and 184 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> respectively. A persistent cross-shelf gradient in NPP is present with higher production offshore, contrasting with patterns observed along the West Antarctic Peninsula. Embayment productivity is intimately tied to sea ice dynamics, with large inter-annual variability in rates of NPP driven by open water area and the timing of embayment opening. Opening of the embayment is linked to periods of positive Southern Annular Mode and stronger westerlies, which lead to the vertical deflection of warm, maritime air over the peninsula and down the leeward side causing increases in surface air temperature and wind velocity. High productivity in these new polynyas is likely to have ramifications for organic matter export and marine ecosystem evolution.

Consequently, it is host to rapidly melting marine glaciers, considerable changes in the sea ice field (transition of coastal perennial sea ice to seasonal ice fields) and marine ecosystem migrations. The Palmer LTER project has been systematically sampling this region since 1993. Presented here are the results of the analysis of twenty years of LTER upper ocean physical data designed to address (among other things): (1) the relationship of shelf waters to those of the (warm) Antarctic circumpolar waters, (2) the dramatic warming of the subsurface waters responsible for melting the ice streams entering the ocean in the Pine Island Bay south of the LTER site, and (3) fundamental ocean changes associated with the dramatic reduction in sea ice and their implications to the ecosystem.

	The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is warming as rapidly as anywhere on Earth, resulting in sea-ice loss, glacial retreat, and rising ocean temperatures. Existing climate gradients and oceanographic boundaries along the WAP can provide insights into the potential response of seafloor ecosystems to this climate warming. First, we present studies of the latitudinal climate gradient along the WAP to explore the potential effects of sea-ice loss on Antarctic shelf-floor communities. We find a varied response of megabenthic and macrobenthic communities to the latitudinal sea-ice gradient, with some parameters apparently insensitive (resilient) while others change linearly or nonlinearly with large variation in annual sea-ice duration. These results suggest that important aspects of seafloor community structure/function may be unexpectedly resilient to changes in pelagic ecosystems driven by sea-ice loss, but that abrupt changes may be expected as climate thresholds are crossed. We then study gradients in seafloor ecosystems from inner fjords out onto the open shelf to explore the influence of terrestrial meltwater and glacial sedimentation on WAP shelf communities. We find that, unlike subpolar Arctic fjords, inner-middle WAP fjords are hotspots of benthic community abundance and beta diversity, and appear to sustain large spatial food-web subsidies from migrating krill. We speculate that these fjord hotspots will be &ldquo;snuffed out&rdquo; but increasing glacial melt and sediment loading resulting from climate warming.&nbsp; Finally, we highlight how the interface between warmer Upper Circumpolar Deep Water and colder Antarctic Shelf Water may form a temperature barrier to predacious king crabs, limiting their dispersal from the deep continental slope up onto the 500-m colder WAP shelf. We demonstrate, however, that a large, reproductive population of king crabs has crossed the Antarctic shelf into the Palmer Deep since the last glacial maximum, and may have dramatically altered seafloor diversity and ecosystem function in the the Palmer Deep. Recent warming trends of shelf waters suggest that, if these king crabs are indeed cold-temperature limited, they might soon move up onto the deep Antarctic shelf, potentially altering the long-isolated, evolutionarily novel shelf-floor ecosystems. &nbsp;In summary, the boundaries/gradients produced by physical and biogeochemical processes along the WAP yield strong patterns of community structure /function in WAP seafloor ecosystems and provide insights into how marine ecosystems in Antarctica are being modified by rapid climate change.

	Since 1995 several ice shelves in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed and triggered ice-mass unloading, invoking a solid Earth response that has been recorded at GPS stations. This offers a rare opportunity to study the time-evolution of the low-viscosity solid Earth response to a well-captured ice unloading event. The previous attempt to model the observation of rapid uplift following the 2002 breakup of Larsen B Ice Shelf failed, being limited by incomplete knowledge of the pattern of ice unloading and possibly the assumption of an elastic-only mechanism.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">We make use of a new high resolution dataset of ice elevation change that captures ice-mass loss north of 66&deg;S to first show that non-linear uplift of the Palmer GPS station since 2002 cannot be explained by an elastic-only signal. We next apply a viscoelastic model with linear Maxwell rheology to predict uplift since 1995. We vary the thickness of the elastic lithosphere and upper mantle viscosity, and test the fit to the Palmer GPS time series showing that the observations may be closely fit with an upper mantle viscosity of less than 2&nbsp;x&nbsp;10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Pa&nbsp;s, much lower than previously modelled. Comparison with vertical velocities from six GPS stations deployed after 2009 (the LARISSA network) verifies the results from the model. Subtracting the modelled uplift rate from the GPS gives insight into glacier loading changes over the late Holocene.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Despite the excellent model-data agreement, wider geophysical and laboratory studies suggest that a more complex rheological model may be required to correctly interpret the observed deformation. We report on investigations into adopting a linear Burgers or power-law rheology, and discuss the constraints placed on such models by this dataset and the potential implication for understanding grounding line stabilization through solid earth rebound.

	Learning happens everywhere and anywhere, and while this mantra is gaining traction, little research exists showing precisely how children and youth migrate through a complex local ecology of STEM or science learning opportunities. Ongoing research in a low-income part of Portland, Oregon as part of the <i>Synergies</i> project is shedding light on this issue. Our study seeks to improve a single community&rsquo;s understanding of how STEM interest develops and how STEM education providers within a community can support that development. We focus on interest rather than other constructs (e.g. attitudes, knowledge, school performance) because research shows that children who have an interest in STEM are significantly more likely to be motivated learners in STEM; they are more likely to seek out challenge and difficulty, use effective learning strategies, and make use of feedback.&nbsp; In addition, children whose interest in STEM is developed and sustained are highly likely to become adults who pursue STEM interests at home and at work and make STEM-informed decisions. Our target population is middle-school aged youth since this is the age when critical STEM education and even career decisions begin to be made. &nbsp;Our initial data suggests that critical triggers are: 1) connections between experiences in and out-of-school; 2) guidance by adults (e.g., parents, teachers, coaches, or other significant adults); and 3) peer relationships. The purpose of our 4-year, longitudinal design-based research study is to develop an innovative approach for empowering whole communities to envision and create a better, more effective community-wide STEM education system. To accomplish this we are working with as many key stakeholders in the community as possible &ndash; parents, schools, after school providers, informal education institutions like science centers and the zoo, libraries, business and industry partners and community welfare agencies &ndash; to build a coordinated approach designed to create data-driven educational strategies to support middle school youth STEM learning.&nbsp; The premise of the project is that if one more fully understood how and why people, in particular early adolescent children, develop STEM-related interests through the utilization of STEM resources and engagement in STEM activities, it should be possible to create a more synergistic and effective STEM education system; a system that more successfully supports STEM learning for all.&nbsp; The key feature is defining the &ldquo;STEM education system&rdquo; as the learning resources/assets of the <i>entire</i> community.

	As formal schooling sharpens its focus on high stakes testing and the metrics of student mastery of content, the role of informal education with its focus on STEM learning through discovering, making, and creating becomes more central to the educational experiences of children. &nbsp;There is much anecdotal information about the long-term impact of out-of-school time experiences. Stories told by scientists, teachers, and others about experiences both good and bad. But the empirical evidence is thin, owning to the difficulty of the task. &nbsp;However, some evidence does exist that offer some clear indications of the connection between positive experiences in youth and long-range impacts. Retrospective data in a survey of physical scientists has shown that 70% developed an interest in science in grade school with about 60% choosing their eventual field of study by high school. Many out-of-school time STEM experiences focus on hand-on activities where students discover, make, and create. More recent studies have shown that students with preferences for learning experiences involving discovering, making, and creating have a significantly greater likelihood of expressing interest in science and engineering-related careers, especially in the critical years of middle school. Coupled with existing research linking early career plans with 2-3 times greater likelihood of actually earning degrees in science and engineering, the research offers some indication of the pathway to STEM beginning early.

	The HIV epidemic puts enormous strain on this workforce globally - especially in Africa, where work overload and inadequate supplies contribute to burnout, driving health workers out of the public health sector; HIV infection amongst health care workers themselves causes significant morbidity and mortality and also further perpetuates the problem of understaffing<sup>. </sup>Moreover, the occupational risk of TB, including multi-drug and extremely-drug resistant TB, poses further serious risk to health workers. Additionally, one of the greatest challenges in implementing programs to reduce the scourge of these diseases in the healthcare workforce is overcoming stigma.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The WHO and ILO, concerned about the health workforce, developed guidelines to improve HIV and TB programs for health workers. These guidelines, also endorsed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, were launched in November 2010, albeit high quality evidence to guide <i>implementation</i> of the WHO-ILO-UNAIDS guidelines was lacking. &nbsp;We therefore began a research programme to fill the identified gaps.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In 2011-2012 we conducted a baseline survey of 1,000 healthcare workers in three large public hospitals in the Free State province of South Africa. We also conducted comprehensive workplace audits for infection control and occupational health hazards. Numerous workplace health concerns were documented. The questionnaire survey, as well as several smaller workplace research projects we conducted as part of our capacity-building efforts with Free State Health personnel, also found a perception among health workers that HIV stigma in the workplace was unacceptably high. In working towards a valid and reliable survey instrument, a pilot questionnaire was developed and administered to 200 healthcare workers - from management and administration, through different types of professional health workers, to non-professional support staff- in one large Free State hospital. Based on the results of the various preliminary assessments, we designed and implemented a trial across the 27 Free State hospitals (all but our pilot hospital) to implement and evaluate a workplace TB-HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment programme for health workers, including a stigma reduction campaign.

	It is not possible to experimentally map all the neurons, synapses, connections, proteins and genes expressed in the brain, let alone to dissect the causal mechanisms underlying their interactions. The Human Brain Project takes a radically different approach &ndash; predictive neuroscience. The project will take data that are already available and known rules governing the structural and functional organization of the brain. It will then use these data and rules to build algorithmically reconstructed models of the brain. Validation against experimental data will make it possible to iteratively improve models and to identify priorities for future experiments. Initial studies by the Blue Brain Project show that this approach can reliably predict many aspects of brain structure and function. In principle, the methods developed in the HBP can be applied to the brain of any species at any age and in any disease state. Brain modelling thus provides a generic and systematic way of determining what can and cannot be predicted and what has to be measured experimentally. Most importantly, brain simulation allows measurements and manipulations impossible in the lab, opening the road to a new kind of <i>in silico </i>experimentation. In summary, HBP predictive neuroscience represents a new strategy for neuroscience research with the potential to unify our understanding of the structure and function of the brain. Predictive neuroscience is especially valuable for research on the human brain, where many of the methods used in animals are not applicable.

The additional challenge of combining diverse datasets to find new relationships in the data requires careful annotation to achieve meaningful data integration. The&nbsp;Neuroinformatics Platform of the Human Brain Project will provide tools to manage, navigate and annotate spatially referenced brain atlases. The project will use these tools&nbsp;to create standardized multi-level atlases of the mouse and&nbsp;human brains, integrating data from the literature, other&nbsp;large-scale neuroscience initiatives, and smaller research&nbsp;groups, inside and outside the HBP. The publicly accessible&nbsp;atlases would provide new incentives for data sharing, and&nbsp;reduce unnecessary duplication of animal experiments. The&nbsp;HBP brain atlases will be the key source of data for the&nbsp;HBP&rsquo;s Brain Simulation Platform. A second key component of the platform will be&nbsp;tools for predictive neuroinformatics. Today, there are so&nbsp;many&nbsp;known gaps in the experimental data, and so many&nbsp;new gaps waiting to be discovered that it will take decades&nbsp;of&nbsp;experiments to build a complete picture of brain structure&nbsp;and function, even in a single species.

Work in the mouse is focused on the thalamo-cortical system underlying vision and visual perception in behaving animals. Work in the human will use cortical tissue from four distinct sources: post-mortem whole brain, surgical resected medial temporal lobe, fetal tissue and inducible-pluripotent stem cells differentiated into forebrain neurons. We are building pipelines to analyze the cellular morphology, electrophysiology, electrical behavior in terms of models and transcriptome of 1,000s of mice and human neurons and to map the structural and functional connectomes at both micro- and meso-scopic scales.

	Singapore is a small country &ndash; a city-state of 5.3 million people and very geographically constrained. Although with a strong economy, its Government has driven hard to re-orientate towards a balanced, knowledge-based economy. This is being achieved through major investments in research, especially in the universities with the result that Singapore is now in the top echelon of research countries. Singapore will become one of the select &lsquo;small smart countries&rsquo; of the World which includes Finland, Israel, Sweden and Switzerland.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">To achieve this position has not only depended on a generous funding system but also to a commitment to excellence by benchmarking internationally and by adopting very rigorous standards, especially of peer-review. The Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore is a good exemplar of this success. Starting out as an institute to train engineers some 30 years ago and committed to the highest international standards, NTU has developed rapidly to become one of the most highly ranked young universities and is in the top 50 global universities.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">This advance has been based on a rigorous appointment, promotion and tenure system and the recruitment of both senior experts from around the World as well as some of the best young brains. The latter face a considerable competition to attain a post at NTU. Now we have to build up local talent to an equivalent level.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">So the pursuit of excellence has to be based on Government commitment and investment, competition and the rigorous adoption of international standards of assessment and this has been the basis of Singapore&rsquo;s (and NTU&rsquo;s) success.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Finally, comparisons will be drawn between Singapore and Asia with the situation in Europe where the speaker has extensive experience at the national (Sweden) level and at the European level.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The advantages of large public research laboratories are self-evident:&nbsp; tackling difficult problems and having expensive one of a kind scientific equipment such as linear accelerators, the Z machine, and that National Synchrotron Light Source, etc.&nbsp; Some disadvantages, which are less evident, are revealed in a large study of 60 research projects across the six programmatic research areas of alternative energies, biology, chemistry, geophysical sciences, material sciences, and inter-disciplinary programs. A carefully constructed research environment instrument developed by Gretchen Jordan at Sandia National Laboratories was used to measure the time spent by 266 scientists on various activities in these projects. The six public research laboratories fit a natural log of size based on the number of scientists with three small, two medium and one large. Significant differences in the allocation of time by programmatic research area existed across six kinds of research activities with chemists only spending about 25% of their time in actual research vs. 44% time for material scientists.&nbsp; An ANOVA analysis indicted that these differences were statistically significant (.001) as were differences by the log of size. Large laboratories significantly reduced the amount of time spent on research and professional activities.&nbsp; Not only was there a reduction in the amount of time but there was also a reduction in how this time was allocated to various processes designed to increase innovation including time spent on creative research, on freedom to explore new ideas, on the ability to take risks and the amount of time the work is exciting.&nbsp; Scientists in projects in the larger organizations report less time spent in each of these processes. Measures of four alternative ways for scientists to learn via the exchanges of information were also reduced by the size of the research laboratory.&nbsp; A novel measure of scientific discontent was developed and found to be strongly and positively related to the log of size. The scientists in the larger laboratories also were less likely to perceived their managers as providing technical content and for their organizations to pursue strategies to increase innovation. Various tests of the face validity of the responses indicate that we can have some confidence in these findings.&nbsp; Finally, one last finding about the impact of organizational size:&nbsp; the less the cooperation and at all levels of the organization.

	Research sponsors, research institutions, policy makers, and other stakeholders in many countries increasingly seek methods to assess and justify the impacts of R&amp;D expenditures. In general, the extant literature indicates that there are relationships between research funding and research outputs, although there is ongoing debate about the nature and direction of effects. Only recently has it been possible to undertake large-scale global analyses of acknowledgements to sponsors and funders in scientific research papers. Using novel data mining methods, we examine acknowledgements to research sponsors in nanotechnology journal papers. Numerous sponsors, including in the United States, have increased funding for scientific research in nanotechnology, and the output of nanotechnology papers has surged in recent years. We investigate funding acknowledgements reported in a data set of 91,000 nanotechnology papers published worldwide since mid-2008. Some of these papers acknowledge multiple funding sources, including funding from more than one country reflecting combinations of national and international co-authorships. Using a two-stage regression model, we examine effects of funding status, the number and diversity of funding sources, international co-funding, funding from leading countries, and other variables on research impacts in terms of journal placement and citations. We discuss the utility and limitations of these impact measures. We find that publications supported by certain sponsors and funding arrangements exhibit higher journal ranking and citation impacts. Not all papers acknowledge research funding, but those acknowledging sponsors and grants are more likely to get published in highly ranked journals and to receive citations. Research supported by multiple sponsors and countries garners greater impact up to a point, with US and European sponsorship more likely to be associated with higher impact. The paper considers the implications for research sponsorship and management, research impact measurement, the internationalization of science, and strategies for leveraging scientific resources and collaborations.

This talk discusses a technical and economic plan to solve these problems by powering 100% of the world, individual countries, and states for all purposes, including electricity, transportation, industry, and heating/cooling, with wind, water, and sunlight (WWS), within 20-40 years. Relevant papers are at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/susenergy2030.html">http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/susenergy2030.html</a>

	Several studies conclude that deep reductions in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from the global energy systems are required by mid-century to mitigate climate change. A review and inter-comparison was conducted of more than a dozen representative scenarios from the literature describing how CO<sub>2</sub> reductions in the range of 50-80 percent could be achieved by 2050. The studies varied significantly in their reliance on energy efficiency, electrification, renewable energy, nuclear power, fossil energy with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and sources of low-carbon transportation fuels.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Four conclusions emerge from this review. First, the pace of energy system transformation required to meet deep carbon reduction targets is substantially higher, and in some cases orders of magnitude higher, than historical experience. At a minimum, achieving this pace of transition will require significantly more &ldquo;technology push&rdquo; and &ldquo;demand pull&rdquo; efforts and policies. Second, given the scale of the challenge and the substantial social, technical, and economic hurdles faced by all available low-carbon energy technologies, removing any particular technology from consideration is likely to limit the chance of success. Third, given the constraints associated with scale up of low carbon technology at the pace described in the scenarios, substantial investments in research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&amp;D) are required to expand and improve our range of feasible decarbonization options. Finally, future studies of decarbonization pathways should explicitly describe their assumptions, relate them to historical experience, and describe key implementation hurdles and solutions; otherwise, such studies are little more than arithmetic exercises describing hypothetical futures.

</td><td>7237</td></tr><tr><td>Symposia</td><td>11633</td><td>The Quantum Nature of Information</td><td> 

	The information revolution is based on what a physicist would call a classical view of information.&nbsp; Quantum effects were long regarded as a mere nuisance for information processing, preventing information in microscopic objects from being observed or copied accurately, but are now known to make possible feats like quantum cryptography and possible dramatic speedups of some computations. More importantly, the quantum approach has led to a more coherent and powerful way of thinking about information.&nbsp; We review this approach, especially the uniquely private form of correlation known as entanglement, which plays a role in many ways complementary to classical information.&nbsp; Quantum principles help explain the origin of randomness, why the future is more uncertain than the past, and why some information is evanescent, while other information becomes ever more durable by being redundantly replicated throughout the environment.&nbsp; The most private information, such the path of an unobserved particle in the famous two-slit experiment, evades this replication and exists only temporarily: after the experiment is over, no record remains anywhere in the universe of what "happened".&nbsp; Less private information includes classical secrets, facts known only to a few, and information like the lost literature of antiquity that once was public but has been forgotten over time. Finally there is information that has been replicated and propagated so widely as to be infeasible to conceal and unlikely to be forgotten. Modern information technology has caused a proliferation of such information, eroding personal privacy along with the ability of tyrants to conceal their misdeeds.&nbsp; Although one might hope that whenever information is amplified to macroscopic size, it becomes ineradicable, we argue that most once-classical, macroscopic information---for example the pattern of drops in last week's rainfall---is impermanent, soon becoming nearly as ambiguous, from a terrestrial perspective, as the path of an unobserved particle. Depending on the diligence and forgetfulness of their enemies, the fate of mysteriously disappeared persons like Jimmy Hoffa, thought to have been murdered in 1977, may by now have acquired this ambiguous status. Finally we discuss the physical prerequisites for a system to accumulate and maintain in its present state, as our world does, a complex and redundant record of at least some features of its past. Thermodynamic disequilibrium, long regarded as key to the origin and maintenance of the world's complexity, also underlies its superficially classical appearance, allowing quantum laws to have remained&nbsp; undiscovered until the 20th century.

	The topic of measurements, information and measurement &lsquo;back-action&rsquo; in quantum mechanics was endlessly confusing to the founders of the field who were forced to argue with each other solely in terms of &lsquo;gedanken&rsquo; experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fantastic progress that has occurred in recent years means that we must face this confusion head on.&nbsp; Yesterday&rsquo;s gedanken experiments are today&rsquo;s real experiments and these exquisitely precise results are putting our understanding of all the twists and turns of quantum measurements to the test.&nbsp; As just one example, it is now possible to use optical techniques to measure the position of a macroscopic mirror with an uncertainty less than the diameter of a single proton!&nbsp; However if we try to measure with even greater precision, the results actually become less certain rather than more certain.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The last two decades have witnessed a revolution in our understanding of the role of information in quantum mechanics and have led to the notion of the quantum computer.&nbsp; Similarly we now better understand the flow of information that occurs when measurements are made and we understand in a precise sense that ideal quantum measurements are ones that do not waste any information.&nbsp; Finally we now understand that it is not just the experimentalist who makes intentional measurements but any &lsquo;observer&rsquo; including the environment surrounding a quantum system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quantum coherence that is essential for the operation of any quantum computer is maintained only as long as no information is lost to the environment.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">This talk will present a simple introductory tutorial on how real measurements work by entangling the state of the quantum system with the state of the measurement apparatus.&nbsp; This will allow us to understand and how the choice of what is measured affects the state of the quantum system being observed.

	Understanding the keys to the productivity of the innovation process is fundamental to addressing the global challenges currently facing the world. By 'productivity of the innovation process', we mean understanding the various mechanisms (and policies) which might enhance the creation and diffusion of knowledge. For many of the wicked challenges facing the world - such as the spectre of climate change - it is crucial that we not only create green technologies but that we increase the speed with which they are adopted by individuals, households and firms. As part of the Australian Science, Technology and Research Assessment (ASTRA), we have examined one commonly-used mechanism used by governments and universities to improve the productivity of the innovation process: rewarding star researchers. The rationale for such schemes is that, by freeing up researchers star researchers from teaching and administrative duties, they can allocate more of their scarce time to valuable research issues. Moreover, star researchers can improve the quality of student/postdoc training, attract extra (industry) funds, participate on other research grant applications and raise the productivity of their peers within the university. In this paper, we observe all of those researchers (Australian and international) who applied for one of a range of Fellowships designed for 'star researchers'. Using this unique dataset enables us to quantify the effects of being granted one of the Fellowships, thereby evaluating one of the chief policies designed to promote Australian research productivity

Accompanying this tremendous surge in shale gas production is a barrage of controversy. At the center of the debate is the well stimulation/completion process known as hydraulic fracturing. Data collected in general population surveys from random samples of individuals in Texas and Pennsylvania are used to empirically examine both objective and perceptual social implications associated with the exploration and production of shale gas. Particularly, these data are used to empirically examine issues associated with the public&rsquo;s views on the process of hydraulic fracturing, the management and disposal of frac flowback wastewaters, and frac flowback wastewater treatment technologies. Lastly, contributions made to self-reported knowledge of hydraulic fracturing by eight different sources and the amount of trust in each of the same sources to deliver unbiased, factual knowledge about the topic are investigated. The findings from this presentation should prove beneficial to the energy industry, community leaders, government and regulatory agencies, environmental and non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders. Possible implications and recommendations of the results are advanced, as are suggestions for future research projects and outreach programs.

	Achieving biosecurity from synthetic and naturally occurring infectious diseases remains incomplete. Efforts to develop specific medical countermeasures have been slower then needed due to the reality that the process is at best expensive, difficult and has an astonishingly low success rate.&nbsp; However biosecurity is not simply vaccines and small molecules, but is a layered system of protective elements that together mitigate the risk to the population and the citizen. Other sectors have examples of how systems of systems work to protect society. Fire and police protection, cyber security, and automobiles are significant exemplars. In the life sciences sector, our efforts to stunt the yearly impact of influenza virus infections hints at the potential that a layered defense to infectious disease can play. In the absence of specific medical countermeasure we might be able to improve our biosecurity through investments in biosurveillance. Biosurveillance is a concept that is interpreted in wildly different ways. In short, biosurveillance provides the critical early warning to act, what are the disease vectors during event, and the metrics for recovery.&nbsp; Recently, the Whitehouse published the National Strategy for Biosurveillance. This document provides the critical guiding principles to frame the science and technology efforts for the invention and integration of the current and future constellation of sensors, data, and knowledge to inform decision makers to save lives.

	Foreign-born scientists and engineers play a large and growing role in the vitality of &nbsp;U.S. science and technology. The advent of rapid and inexpensive international communications and transportation are changing the way research is done, facilitating multi-national careers and collaborations. To maintain our scientific vitality, the U.S. visa and immigration systems need to respond to these trends. A number of issues must be addressed in order to facilitate the flow of foreign-born scientists, engineers, and STEM students to the U.S. for education, research visits, and conferences. This paper, based on a study of the U.S. visa and immigration systems as they affect foreign scientists, engineers, and students, suggests some avenues for accomplishing this.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Delays in visa processing, generally due to the security review process known as Visas Mantis, continue to be a major irritant in the system, especially after security was tightened following 9/11. Finding ways to speed up these reviews and make the process more transparent would go a long way toward smoothing the path for visa applicants without compromising security. Bringing more technical expertise to the consular level where decisions on Mantis reviews are made would help, as would providing applicants with at least some information about the status of their applications beyond the bland and opaque statement that they are undergoing &ldquo;administrative processing.&rdquo;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">&nbsp;An issue of particular importance to students from developing nations, especially China and India (which together account for 64% of foreign-born STEM students in the U.S), is the provision of immigration law known as 214(b), which requires all nonimmigrant visa applicants to show that they are not intending to use their visas as a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; to immigrate to the U.S. permanently. Some analysts contend that failure to satisfy this provision, which accounts for a large share of visa denials, is used by consular officers to misrepresent the basis of their decisions. Because many students change their minds after a few years in the U.S., a means to allow for that uncertainty&mdash;called &ldquo;dual intent&rdquo; in immigration policy&mdash;would make the process more honest as well as more equitable.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Other proposals that could help streamline procedures include providing consulates greater authority to waive personal interviews (currently mandatory), expanding the visa waiver program to more countries, and, more generally infusing the administrative and enforcement culture of the visa and immigration systems with a stronger service ethic.

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Differentiated adult human nasal chondrocytes (hNC) exhibit a regenerative capacity for cartilage repair and, accordingly to their neuro-ectodermal origin, a phenotypical plasticity. While literature suggests that hNC are also capable of osteoblastic differentiation, their bone forming capacity has never been investigated. The aim of this study is to assess the potential of hNC to follow one or both of the archetypal routes of bone formation (endochondral and intramembranous). HNC-based cartilage grafts developed features typical of hypertrophy in vitro (type X collagen: xx fold upregulation), but did not proceed throughout endochondral ossification upon subcutaneous implantation into nude mice, yielding stable hyaline-like cartilage. However, when subjected to direct osteoblastic differentiation culture in a ceramic-based scaffold, hNC deposited a highly mineralized matrix and unregulated the expression of the key osteogenic genes cbfa-1 (15-fold) and BMP-2 (80-fold). While subsequent ectopic implantation into nude mice indeed resulted in hNC-containing bone, the process was inefficient (&lt;5% total bone). To explain this inefficiency, we performed a clonal study that demonstrated the relatively low (&lt;30%) percentage of osteogenic hNC clones present in nasal cartilage. Hypothesizing orthotopic environmental influences could boost the osteogenic subpopulation towards efficient bone formation, we then tested the hNC-containing ceramic constructs in a calvarian defect model (intramembranous bone repair). Remarkably, orthotopic implantation demonstrated that hNC were not only able to survive in a homotopic boney environment, but also able to actively contribute to new bone formation, both contrary to the gold standard heterotopic cell source (bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells).
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Our findings show that orthotopic, and perhaps homotopic, environmental cues are essential for hNC to survive and actively produce intramembranous bone. From a broader biological perspective, we demonstrate that environmental cues can suffice for the direct conversion of human chondrocytes into functional osteoblasts.

	Participatory modeling (that is, scientists and stakeholders working together to construct a model jointly) has been used in a variety of fields for several decades, and is becoming increasingly popular to address environmental problems. However, its application to climate change adaptation remains underdeveloped, in spite of the many potential benefits participatory modeling might offer in a decision-making context that involves complexity and uncertainty. Here, I discuss building a participatory system dynamics model to address the problem of extreme heat in urban areas and its impacts on human health. Climate change models have predicted an increase in the frequency, duration and severity of deadly heat events globally. Hot weather kills more people in the United States annually than any other type of natural disaster, and the impacts of heat on human health will be a major climate change adaptation challenge for urban planners, health officials, and emergency managers. There are biophysical, socio-economic, and behavioral components to the health impacts of extreme heat, but the interactions among these types of variables are rarely examined. We developed a system dynamics modeling framework that incorporates biophysical, socio-economic, and behavioral aspects of extreme heat risk in Michigan, and are in the process of extending the model application to other cities in the northern U.S. We developed the model with the participation of partners in decision-making positions at the county and state level in Michigan. Using a participatory system dynamics model to address a climate change adaptation problem allowed stakeholders to test options for mitigating the effects of heat on human health using the model, and to observe the interactions among various modeled components. The model revealed some important limitations of previous approaches to reducing deaths and hospitalizations caused by extreme heat, which have tended to prioritize educational efforts and cooling centers. Overall, we found this participatory system dynamics modeling approach to be a powerful tool for illuminating the systemicity of the problem of extreme heat in urban areas, and for identifying the best ways to help vulnerable populations. The model could be even more powerful if linked with spatial information about heat risk.

	Cereal grains in most developing countries commonly are contaminated with mycotoxins produced primarily by fungi in the <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Fusarium</i> genera.&nbsp; Aflatoxins, produced by several <i>Aspergillus</i> species, are the best known, while fumonisins, produced by several <i>Fusarium</i> species, also are a widespread, serious contaminant.&nbsp; Both toxins are more common in maize than they are in indigenous African grains, <i>e.g.</i>, sorghum and millet. &nbsp;Sorghum and millets also thrive under hot, dry conditions, while maize yields poorly.&nbsp; Encouraging maize cultivation on marginal lands under suboptimal conditions increases the likelihood and severity of the mycotoxin contamination in grain usually consumed by the poorest farmers in the region.&nbsp; As global climate change pushes African climates to further extremes, this problem will increase.&nbsp; Reevaluation of the native African cereals to address nutritional needs is seriously needed given their generally low level of mycotoxin contamination.&nbsp; Many <i>Fusarium</i> spp. grow endophytically within the plant and produce toxin only when the host matures or becomes stressed.&nbsp; Identifying signals that shift the fungus from endophyte to pathogen and/or trigger toxin biosynthesis could identify critical points for controlling disease and toxin production.&nbsp; One approach to reducing aflatoxin levels is biocontrol with aflatoxin-nonproducing strains of <i>Aspergillus</i>.&nbsp; A similar strategy for fumonisins is possible, but would require more significant strain development than is needed for <i>Aspergillus</i>. &nbsp;This biocontrol method also may not reduce losses due to plant disease caused by the biocontrol strains.&nbsp; Mycotoxin-contaminated grain has its biggest impact in rural areas.&nbsp; Traders usually purchase only the best grain from rural farmers.&nbsp; Rural inhabitants often eat a diet composed primarily of maize, perhaps as much as 500 g/person/day.&nbsp; Thus, rural farmers in less developed countries are exposed to higher levels of toxins than almost anyone else on the planet.&nbsp; They eat the most heavily contaminated grain available, and they eat more of it.&nbsp; SPSS trade restrictions similarly concentrate contaminated foods in these countries, as only relatively uncontaminated foods are allowed into international commerce leaving highly contaminated foodstuffs concentrated in countries with the least ability to deal with it.&nbsp; Policies that ensure food security in rural regions and that allow contaminated grain to be blended and used for other purposes are needed to remove this contaminated grain from the human food chain and enable its effective utilization.

	Children of economically and educationally disadvantaged parents typically enter school with poorer language skills than their more privileged counterparts. By some measures, 5-year-old children of lower socioeconomic status (SES) score two years behind on standardized language development tests by the time they enter school. We will show that the language gap between rich and poor children begins to emerge in infancy.&nbsp; In a longitudinal study we examined developmental changes in language proficiency in English-learning infants from higher- and lower-SES families. Significant SES differences in both vocabulary and real-time language processing efficiency were already evident at age 18 months. &nbsp;By age 24 months, there was a 6-month gap between SES groups in processing skills critical to language development. &nbsp;Such a large disparity cannot be dismissed as a transitory delay, given that differences in trajectories of language growth established by age 3 years tend to persist and are predictive of later school success or failure.&nbsp; Where do such early differences among children come from, and what can be done to improve these outcomes? One critical factor is that parents differ in the amount of language stimulation they provide their infants at home.&nbsp; We present evidence showing that parents who talk more with their children in an engaging and supportive way have children who are more likely to develop their full intellectual potential than are those who hear less child-directed speech. Using the LENA<sup>TM</sup> technology to make all-day recordings of low SES Spanish-learning children in their home environment, we found striking variability in how much parents talked to their children.&nbsp; Infants who heard more child-directed speech developed greater efficiency in language processing and learned new words more quickly. Our results indicate that exposure to child-directed speech - but not to overheard speech - sharpens infants&rsquo; language processing skills, with cascading benefits for vocabulary learning.&nbsp; However, the conclusion that parents should use more and richer language with infants to support early learning meets with opposition in some cultures. &nbsp;Cross-cultural research in some West African societies reveals social norms against making eye contact with or talking to an infant, practices viewed as potentially harmful rather than as beneficial to the young child.&nbsp; We discuss the challenges of developing culturally sensitive interventions to help parents understand their critical role in actively nurturing young children&rsquo;s brain development and language growth.

	Socioeconomic disparities in childhood are associated with remarkable differences in cognitive and socio-emotional development during a time when dramatic changes are occurring in the brain. Yet, the neurobiological pathways through which socioeconomic status (SES) shapes development remain poorly understood. Behavioral evidence suggests that, relative to other neurocognitive systems, language development exhibits particularly large differences across SES. This may be understood through a theoretical model linking SES differences in linguistic exposure to brain and behavioral development. Specifically, socioeconomic disparities in the quantity and quality of linguistic stimulation in the home have been well described, with higher SES families more likely to speak to children with greater frequency and complexity; spend more hours in parent-child reading activities; and provide increased access to books and other language-related resources. These differences in linguistic exposure have in turn been directly related to child language development. Further, research suggests that differences in linguistic exposure may be associated with developmental differences in language-supporting cortical regions in the left hemisphere. Taken together, the above evidence suggests that socioeconomic disparities, which are associated with large differences in access to language-promoting resources, are likely to be associated with differences in the development brain regions which support the development of language. Here evidence is reviewed from several studies using various modalities (EEG, structural/functional MRI) suggesting that socioeconomic disparities exist in structure and function of regions of the brain that support language processing. It is proposed that these neural differences in structure and function may mediate previously described SES disparities in children&rsquo;s language skills. Further, effects of experiential differences in language exposure on brain structures may snowball over time, with cumulative consequences for later academic outcomes.

	Relocating science into the heart of society &ndash; by expanding a process called citizen science &ndash; can deliver two keys that humanity needs to create a sustainable world: reliable knowledge and social capital.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Even though curiosity is a universal human trait, the enterprise of scientific discovery is kept outside our culture, not a part of our collective identity, not integrated into our rituals and customs. It is carried out by an elite few, making it an easy target for attacks on its credibility and requiring specialized communicators to bridge the enormous gap between those creating knowledge and those for whom the knowledge is created. This is a serious problem because there are two interlocking keys needed to solve problems: (i) reliable knowledge of what can be done and (ii) social capital to make it happen. (The social networks, cohesion, and individual investment in community that makes democracy work better are social capital). Right now these two keys are separated from each other. The scientific enterprise is not broken (it is still making knowledge), but it can&rsquo;t efficiently do its part in solving problems while located apart from society. The remedy is to relocate science from its isolation and foster its growth in the mainstream of society as an ongoing collaboration between the public and professionals. How can we do this? Citizen Science has already begun to do it, every day, and we need to expand the process. From the last decade of studying the phenomena of citizen science, we now know that citizen science co-creates highly reliable scientific knowledge <i>and</i> weaves social capital. Citizen science is still in its infancy and if we grow it, we have an opportunity to develop systems of engagement and participation aimed at collective problem-solving. In this context, I will discuss the current trends and frontiers in the emerging discipline of citizen science.

Would the advent of community-scale renewable energy microgrids change the current institutional organization of energy and electricity supply in this country? How would such microgrids be organized?&nbsp; How might they fit into a broader national energy strategy (were one ever to be developed)? These are questions that have been on the table since at least the 1970s, generating a broad range of responses from a broad range of respondents.&nbsp; Almost 40 years ago, Amory Lovins argued that renewables would be &ldquo;more democratic&rdquo; by avoiding the centralization and authoritarian tendencies associated with nuclear power, in particular.&nbsp; Others, such as Langdon Winner, pointed out that it was not the technology that determined politics but, rather, politics that shaped technology. Many, of course, simply ignore such matters. &nbsp;&nbsp;With hindsight, it is possible to tease out how technology and social factors are co-constitutive of large-scale systems, such as is found in electricity production and distribution.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In this presentation, I suggest that the sociological and political effects of renewable energy microgrids need to be considered at several different scales:&nbsp; the community, the macrogrid, and the broader society.&nbsp; I propose that, if we are to actually pursue an energy strategy based on such microgrids, it is very important to first understand the institutional framework within which this would take place and only then focus on technological systems and issues.

	In 2011, an ulcerative dermatitis and alopecia emerged among ice associated Arctic seals and potentially Pacific Walruses, on the Arctic Slope, Western Arctic, and Bering Strait.&nbsp; The observed increased morbidity and mortality among seals and Pacific walruses led to the subsequent declaration of an unusual mortality event for these species by NOAA and the USFWS. To date, this disease of seals has been confirmed in the US Arctic, NWT (CA), Chukotka (Ru), and northern Japan. In response to the disease event a large scale trans-boundary interdisciplinary disease investigative team joining Native hunters from Alaska, Chuktoka, NWT and international scientists was assembled.&nbsp; Comprehensive tier 1 and tier 2 disease investigative efforts were being pursued. Initial investigative efforts have ruled out numerous bacteria, viruses, contaminants and algae toxins known to affect marine mammals. Advanced testing techniques for unidentified infectious agents is continuing as well as further testing for potential other causes including, radiation, auto-immune, nutritional, hormonal and environmental factors. Currently no specific cause has been identified. The disease is characterized by a variety of skin associated lesions (ulcers/erosion) with body site specific distribution (eyes; snout; hind flippers; tail, trunk) for ice seals and a more generalized distribution for Pacific walrus. All age classes have been affected in ice seals. For Pacific walrus sub-adults and calves appear primarily affected. Affected ice seals displayed uncommon behaviors such as unusual approachability, lethargy, and increased tendency for hauling out on land. In some animals respiratory signs are prominent. Gross necropsy and histopathological lesions found in seals and walruses were associated with the respiratory system, the liver, the immune system, and the skin associated vascular bed.&nbsp; Disease surveillance efforts in 2012 and 2013 indicate that the disease event has come to an end as no new cases similar to the initial 2011 clinical presentation were observed. Ice seals and Pacific walruses are key species within the Arctic Ecosystem and an essential marine subsistence resource for Native communities throughout the Arctic. Thus food safety and food security aspects are integral components of this emerging Arctic marine mammal disease.

Players are given a virtual supply of &ldquo;energy points&rdquo; in a virtual &ldquo;Energy Tank.&rdquo; During game play, this tank reflects the energy impact of each choice: the more energy in the tank, the better. The <i>Future Energy Chicago</i> simulation is both a collaborative and a competitive experience and the teams&rsquo; ongoing results are aggregated on the scoreboard in real time.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The simulation&rsquo;s scoring system is grounded in real-world data and the software includes a content management system allowing the Museum to update the raw data as conditions change over time. The games incorporate a variety of design elements to provide students with incentives and a variety of difficulty levels as well as support mechanisms such that the students can feel both challenged and successful.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Through this collaborative game-based play, students learn science and technology concepts related to energy efficiency and how they play out in the real world. &nbsp;The museum-based experience is facilitated by the Museum&rsquo;s education staff and is accompanied by a pre-and post visit in-classroom curriculum. The presentation will include visual representations of the simulation as well as a discussion of how games-based learning has been incorporated into the experience design.&nbsp; In this session, the panel will also present ongoing research and evaluation results designed to understand the impact on students&rsquo; learning and engagement with the topic of energy and its underlying science and technology.

Sea ice thickness continues to decrease, while autumn temperatures increase, suggesting that the Arctic climate system has reached a &lsquo;New Normal&rsquo; state. &nbsp;Concurrently, lower trophic level plankton and benthic fauna are responding to the &lsquo;new&rsquo; environmental forcing at variable time and space scales.&nbsp; Changes to these prey populations can have energetic impacts to upper trophic level predators, as well as alter trophic transfer of biotoxins and contaminants.&nbsp; In addition, increasing offshore anthropogenic activities can alter marine mammal exposure and response to infectious disease, underwater sound and potential trauma from ship strikes. &nbsp;Two new programs, the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) and the Synthesis of Arctic Research (SOAR), include tracking of marine mammal and lower level prey base responses to ecosystem shifts associated with sea ice loss.&nbsp; Both programs can provide an environmental base to a Marine Mammal Health Mapping program, envisioned as a component of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). &nbsp;&nbsp;An overarching goal is to identify &lsquo;New Normal&rsquo; patterns for marine mammals, as a foundation for integrative research, local response and adaptive management.</span>

	When we observe kids &ldquo;glued to games&rdquo; (Rigby &amp; Ryan, 2011), it is natural to want to harness that eagerness for educational ends. The New York Hall of Science&rsquo;s Center for Play, Science and Technology Learning (SciPlay), in partnership with Concord Consortium, set out to explore the impact of an educational game on students&rsquo; motivation, engagement, affect, science aspirations, and learning. Thus we created GeniGames, an online game where high school students breed dragons &ndash; dragons that are based on real lizard genes. &nbsp;In order to generate a gaming experience, we built into the game the three game-based design elements of narrative, competition, and sociality.&nbsp; Our research compared the following conditions: (1) GeniGames with its game-based design elements (GG), (2) GeniGames without any game-based design elements (GLO) and (3) business as usual (BAU).&nbsp; GG and GLO used similar technology and GLO imparted the same genetics content taught through a project-based science curriculum; BAU teachers taught the content using their typical approaches. This spring, 18 New York City high school biology teachers received professional development and they and their 812 students participated in one of these three interventions.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">During this session, we will share what we have learned about the impact of game-based design elements on students&rsquo; affective dimensions and learning using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies.&nbsp; Surveys, originating from psychological research on affective dimensions, were administered to students. &nbsp;Additionally, a genetics assessment was constructed and administered that integrated what is known in the literature about typical student misconceptions in genetics. Initial results using Hierarchical Linear Modeling indicated that by the end of the study, GG students as a whole felt significantly more intrinsic motivation regarding science learning than BAU students (F=6.57, p&lt;.01).&nbsp; We will also present portraits of sub-populations of students who differed from their group as a whole in being more positively or negatively impacted with regard to their learning and/or their affective dimensions. Classroom observation and focus group data were analyzed and combined with our quantitative findings to gain further insight into the importance of game-based design elements.&nbsp; Finally, we will discuss how computer trace logs were used to supplement our understanding of students&rsquo; behavior and thinking.

	A subset of CD4+ T cells derived from the thymus co-express the interleukin-2 receptor (CD25), termed regulatory T cells (Tregs) and upon migration to the periphery are potently immune suppressive and critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has proven to be effective in treating malignant and non-malignant disorders but has as a major complication, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a multi-organ system immune complication. In rodents, we and others showed that infusing large numbers of Tregs along with the donor cells prevented GVHD. In humans, Tregs have similar properties but are present in lower frequency. Using cell isolation techniques and in vitro approaches to expand Tregs using microbeads coupled to immunostimulatory antibodies, we performed a first-in-human trial of umbilical cord blood derived Tregs given to patients receiving unrelated donor cord blood transplants for hematological malignancies. We observed no toxicity and a significant reduction but not elimination of GVHD. Since Treg number remained limiting, we developed a cell-based expansion approach to obtain many more Tregs. We are now in the midst of a clinical trial infusing sufficient numbers of Tregs to better test the principle that this suppressor population can markedly reduce GVHD that may eventually lead to the abiilty to forgo immune suppressive drugs entirely. The concept of Treg infusion for restoring immune regulation is now being applied to autoimmune settings such as type I diabetes.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Exploring Computer Science (ECS) is an NSF sponsored national program committed to broadening participation in computer science at the high school level, with a specific focus on access for students of color.<span>&nbsp; ECS began in Los Angeles Unified School District in partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles and has now expanded to a wide range of schools and districts nationally.</span><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">To carry out the mission of broadening participation in computing the ECS program has focused on the following essential areas: Curriculum, Professional Development, Assessment, and Policy. At the heart of our work is a commitment to equity.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The ECS curriculum consists of lessons for six instructional units:<span>&nbsp; 1. Human Computer Interaction; 2. Problem Solving; 3. Web Design; 4. Introduction to Programming; 5. Computing and Data Analysis and; 6. Robotics.&nbsp; Together these units formulate a year-long course that reinforce the unifying themes of creativity, technology as a problem solving tool and the relevance and impact of computer science while supporting the problem solving and computational practices associated with doing computer science.</span><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Importantly, ECS is a program that includes the curriculum in combination with ECS teacher professional development. Unfortunately, it is all too common for CS education reform efforts to focus narrowly on the subject matter of the discipline, with little consideration to radically transforming teacher pedagogy and associated classroom culture. Our ECS guiding philosophy is that there is a deep connection between teaching and learning, and that handing educators a new curriculum is not sufficient to support inquiry and equity-based teaching, which are necessary ingredients for broadening participation in computing.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In addition, we believe teachers are essential to challenging the deep-seated stereotypes and belief systems that continue in computer science, and for shaping learning experiences for students who have been traditionally underrepresented in the field so that all students experience &ldquo;doing&rdquo; computer science and belonging in the field.&nbsp; Teachers need opportunities to reflect with others about their own teaching especially when it comes to issues of equity.

	Survey research shows that fewer scientists believe in God or a higher power than members of the general public, but by no means does scientist equate to atheist. Scientists, like bricklayers or ballet dancers, can be religious, non-religious, anti-religious, or religiously indifferent. Scientists who are nonbelievers sometimes generalize their views to all scientists, which can miscommunicate to religious communities and the public in general that science is incompatible with religion. Although some religious views clearly are incompatible with the discoveries of science, and certain religious perspectives clash with the evidence-based method science uses to derive conclusions, most religious perspectives found among Americans do not reject either the methods or the conclusions of science. This in itself, though a simple idea, is also one that scientists need to communicate to the public. Conservative Christians, in particular, often reject science because they believe that in accepting science, they will be forced to accept materialist philosophy. Distinguishing between the methodological materialism of science and the philosophical materialism of humanism and other non-theistic views frees science for acceptance on its own terms. Scientists also must realize that the presentation of science, though necessary, is not sufficient in itself. For topics such as religion or climate change, where there may be religiously-based opposition, &ldquo;mere&rdquo; science will not be persuasive on its own. Research shows that ideological orientation trumps empiricism: liberals are more likely to accept information if they believe the position originates from a fellow liberal, conservatives are more likely to accept the identical information if they believe the position originates from a fellow conservative, and so on. To overcome ideological barriers to the acceptance of science requires establishing a relationship of trust and respect. This relationship is most easily established by individuals of the same ideology, but it is not impossible for &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; to do so. Otherwise, an adversarial relationship is the default, to the detriment of the public understanding of science

	Cancer progression involves complex, dynamical tumor-host interactions at many time and spatial scales. To detangle this complex system, cancer scientists create and investigate a variety of experimental and computational models. In experimental biology, this has given rise to multiscale data sets gathered from multiple measurement platforms that give important but fragmented insights on cancer, and can be difficult to integrate into a more comprehensive view. This is further compounded by a general lack of standardized quantifications, especially at the multicell and tissue scales. Computational models face similar challenges: a variety of sophisticated models simulate specific cancers or cancer aspects, but a lack of data standardizations (particularly at the multicell and tissue scales) has hindered data sharing, interoperability, and model integration. In this talk, we draw upon insights from hurricane forecasting, computer animation, and other fields to explore solutions to these problems.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">We will present examples of combining computational models to integrate multiscale <i>in vitro </i>and <i>in vivo </i>experimental data and gain new insights on cancer progression and outcome. We will show progress in developing data standards to describe <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> cancer experiments and simulations at the cell and tissue scales, and how these are giving rise to repositories of not only time series data, but also digitized cell lines and tissues. We will discuss efforts to create graphical tools that can edit and recombine these digitized cells and tissues to configure novel cancer simulations, much like graphic artists can import characters and scenes into computer graphics software to create games. Lastly, we explore the long-term implications. We will discuss a future where data standards and software integration platforms allow computational oncologists to seamlessly combine tumor growth, therapy response, and other modules into sophisticated and accurate simulators to improve patient clinical outcomes. We will consider the potential impact of making these computer models accessible not only to modelers, but also to biologists, clinicians, educators, and the general public. We will discuss a future where biopsies could be seeded into bioreactors and assayed to create patient-specific digitized cell lines, which can then be read by ensembles of compatible simulators to explore, compare, and help guide the patient&rsquo;s treatment choice. Creating this future will require cooperation throughout the cancer research and clinical communities, and is already underway.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">What role do funders play in shaping our conceptions of the relations between discovery and innovation, and how do they shape the practice of science and the character of scientists? This&nbsp;presentation explores how to create an environment that fosters innovative discovery, focusing specifically on the&nbsp;role private&nbsp;foundations have historically and most effectively played in supported discovery and perhaps innovation via the &lsquo;informal college&rsquo;.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">&nbsp;An attempt to analyze how private foundations support fosters American science and technology must begin with an historical perspective.&nbsp; The transition from the 19<sup>th</sup> to the 20<sup>th</sup> century witnessed the development of two institutions that in many ways are uniquely American: the privately endowed foundation and the research university.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new tradition of organized giving was distinct from the tradition of personal charity or &ldquo;almsgiving&rdquo;.&nbsp; Instead, foundations with large established endowments were to supply venture capital for the common good.&nbsp; Carnegie targeted his giving toward &ldquo;&hellip;institutions connected with alleviation of human suffering, and especially with the prevention rather than the cure of human ills&rdquo;.&nbsp; Rockefeller, guided by his philanthropic advisor Frederick Gates, found himself &ldquo;laying aside retail giving almost wholly, and entering safely and pleasurably into the field of wholesale philanthropy.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">National science policy, even when concentrating on basic research, sets funding priorities in response to national interests.&nbsp; Such policies inevitably result in underfunded areas of research, creating opportunities for private foundations.&nbsp; One such opportunity presented itself in 1988, when the United States Department of Health and Human services issued a moratorium on the use of federal funds for research evaluating fetal cell transplantation as a potential treatment for Parkinson&rsquo; Disease.&nbsp; Private dollars funded the continuation of the research, including studies contributing to a deeper understanding of the political and ethical issues relevant to the moratorium. Foundation dollars can also be pivotal during the start-up phase of novel, emerging, and cross-disciplinary research programs which have not yet captured the attention of federal funding agencies.&nbsp; Rockefeller Foundation support was crucial to the development of modern molecular biology.&nbsp; The Sloan Foundation catalyzed the emergence of neuroscience and cognitive science and the McDonnell Foundation supported the development of cognitive neuroscience as distinct academic disciplines.&nbsp; The Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust&rsquo;s interest in developmental biology helped revitalize this field by encouraging researchers to apply advances from cellular and molecular biology.&nbsp; History indicates that foundations are often most effective when awarding short- to intermediate-term transitional support for new areas of research where relatively small grants can help launch new research initiatives.

	There are 29 putative populations of beluga worldwide with 5 distinct groups in Alaska and 7 in Canada.&nbsp; There are healthy robust, diminished but stable, and declining beluga populations throughout their ranges.&nbsp; These animals are predominantly circumpolar, subsistence hunted in Canada, Alaska, Russia and Greenland and integral to the natural history and folklore of aboriginal peoples.&nbsp; Because of these factors, beluga are excellent sentinels of ecosystem health. To establish baseline information on the health status and potential zoonotic concerns of hunter harvested whales for human consumption, long term multi-institutional and multidisciplinary studies have been undertaken on dead beach cast and hunter harvested animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After collection of morphometric data, harvest of muktuk and muscle, internal organs are assessed and representative samples collected for histopathology and ancillary research and diagnostic studies.&nbsp; Laboratory and necropsy results vary considerable across populations and geographic regions; however, there are specific disease entities that are consistently identified in animals.&nbsp; Degenerative changes within the thyroid and adrenal glands of most whales and profound interstitial pneumonia in select individuals.&nbsp; Polymerase chain reaction was negative for influenza virus, West Nile virus, <i>Brucella</i> spp, morbillivirus and a small number of animals were positive by consensus primers for Mollicutes and typical <i>Mycobacterium</i> spp.&nbsp;&nbsp; Serology for <i>Brucella </i>spp has consistent identified positive animals with annual variations between 4 to 18% of sampled animals.&nbsp; Tissues screened for Apicomplexa detected a large proportion of infected whales.&nbsp; Enzyme digestion assays conducted on skeletal musculature were negative for <i>Trichinella spp.</i>; however, pooled tissue samples were positive for <i>Hemabartonella</i> spp and <i>Hemobartonella canis</i>.&nbsp; Contaminants such as PCB&rsquo;s, PBDEs have been measured in blubber and Hg was measured in skin, muscle and liver with evidence of long term declining trends in this heavy metal. Toxin associated endocrine endpoint have also been measured in blubber and blood.&nbsp; From a nutritional/conditional perspective lipid classes and fatty acids have been measured in blubber and stable isotopes were determined in liver to assess trophic feeding. These ongoing investigations provide seminal baseline information into the health status of beluga whales. Additional comprehensive studies in the future will assess possible trends and potential impact of these factors on population status.

	Marine ecosystems are in global decline. New transformational changes in governance have been advocated to cope with overfishing, pollution, climate change, and other drivers of degradation. Here I explore the outcomes of a governance transformation, which resulted in a revolutionary national system that allocates exclusive territorial user rights to artisanal fisher associations (TURFs) in Chile. The presentation specifically assesses the extent to which the capacity for stewardship of coastal social-ecological systems is enhanced through the implementation of TURFs. It assesses the implications of the transformation over the social-ecological systems adaptive capacity and identifies opportunities for enhancing continuous innovation cycles aimed at achieving sustainability. Results highlight that fisheries management &ldquo;silver bullets&rdquo; do not exist and provide insights on how to assess stewardship capacity as a response variable from governance transformations. The talk concludes by showing how stewardship capacity is triggering innovative sustainability pathways.

	The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond has emerged as a powerful, optically addressable, spin-based probe of electromagnetic fields and temperature through the precise quantum control of a single electron spin state. For nanoscale sensing applications, the NV center&rsquo;s atom-like nature enables the close-range interactions necessary for both high spatial resolution and the detection of fields generated by proximal nuclei, electrons, or molecules. Using a custom-designed optical tweezers apparatus, we demonstrate three-dimensional position control of nanodiamonds in solution with simultaneous optical measurement of electron spin resonance (ESR) [1]. Single crystal diamond nanoparticles containing NV centers were microfabricated and subsequently suspended in the optical trap, enabling the observation of distinct peaks in the ESR spectra from the ground-state spin transitions. We model the ESR spectra observed in an applied magnetic field and estimate the dc magnetic sensitivity based on the ESR line shapes to be ~10 &mu;T/&radic;Hz.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Moreover, using dynamical decoupling protocols to convert thermally induced shifts in the NV center&rsquo;s spin resonance frequencies into large changes in its fluorescence, we demonstrate fluorescence thermometry techniques with sensitivities approaching 10 mK&radic;Hz based on the spin-dependent photoluminescence of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond [2]. These techniques use dynamical decoupling protocols to convert thermally induced shifts in the NV center&rsquo;s spin resonance frequencies into large changes in its fluorescence. We show that these quantum-based measurement techniques can be applied over a broad temperature range and in both finite and near-zero magnetic field environments. This versatility suggests that the quantum coherence of single spins could be practically leveraged for sensitive thermometry in a wide variety of biological and microscale systems.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Optically trapped nanodiamonds are also used to probe the local environment within microfluidic circuits, providing a pathway to spin-based sensing in fluidic environments and biophysical systems that are inaccessible to existing scanning probe techniques, such as the interiors of living cells.

	The regime between ~5 and ~100 coupled spins marks the transition region between quantum and classical magnetism. Harboring the mysterious beginnings of many bulk magnetic phenomena, this regime is frustratingly difficult to access, both experimentally and computationally. In our research we use STM atom manipulation combined with local electron tunneling spectroscopy as a way to chart this promising region. By arranging Fe atoms on a Cu<sub>2</sub>N surface we can both detect and control magnetic anisotropy as well as spin coupling between neighboring atoms. In chains comprising as few as five atoms, we start to see signs of magnetic reversal at timescales in the order of seconds. Numerical calculations reveal that delocalized spin wave states play an important role in the switching dynamics of the chain.

	Spin pumping, the transfer of spin angular momentum from the resonantly driven magnetization of a ferromagnet into an adjacent material, represents an intriguing phenomenon with potentially significant technological importance. Scanned probe magnetic resonance is a powerful tool in this context offering high resolution magnetic resonance imaging, localized spin excitation and direct measurement of spin relaxation and damping. Because it is based on direct detection of the dipole interaction between a micromagnetic probe and the ensemble of spins under study, it is applicable to a broad variety of spin-containing materials, and deeply buried regions can be imaged. Here we report on microscopic scanned probe magnetic resonance studies of spin dynamics, and explore the relationships between spin lifetime and transport. Electron spin resonance measurements of nanostructured volumes of diamond containing nitrogen impurities reveal an unexpected sensitivity of spin dynamics to confinement of the volume under study. Scanned probe ferromagnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a novel magnetic imaging technique based on Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy&amp;nbsp;that offers the ability to image nanoscale properties of buried ferromagnets. Able to map internal fields with spectroscopic precision, FMRI offers a unique approach to the study of dynamics of microscopic ferromagnets and localized spin waves.

	Global Health is a rapidly growing field for research, service, and educational engagement. With an energetic, increasingly diverse student body, faculty representing multiple disciplines and performing cutting edge science, and increasingly supportive administrations, universities provide great settings for the development and implementation of global health programs.&nbsp; As a result, students and trainees at all levels are seeking opportunities for both didactic and experiential training in global health. In response, there are now over 100 academic programs engaged in global health in the US alone.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">At Duke University, we have developed a comprehensive portfolio of interdisciplinary global health education programs with a focus on reducing global health disparities. These educational programs seek to prepare global health leaders with the skills to solve complex problems, and the experience of working in communities abroad, in teams and across disciplines. Highlights include one of the first Masters of Science (M.Sc.) in Global Health and a recently approved undergraduate major. Through a tailored, flexible curriculum, students in both programs develop an understanding of the larger context of global health, while learning from faculty and other students approaching the topic of global health from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. All students participate in experiential learning with one of many collaborating institutions around the world.

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">The main contribution is enhanced methods and tools for a risk based approach to container profiling and targeting. By using an all-sources fusion based approach, it is possible to improve the selection of which containers to inspect or scan for dangerous and illegal substances.

	<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Human remains impose numerous and diverse demands upon those who are charged with their custody or release.&nbsp; Demands can be public and private, communal and individual, according to circumstance.&nbsp; At different times the prevailing interests may coincide, coalesce or conflict.&nbsp; Divergent principles may emerge at the point of discovery, relocation, attribution, treatment and destination.&nbsp;&nbsp; In some quarters the role of museums may be pivotal, in others marginal. In no sphere is the challenge to institutions more exacting and delicate than in the treatment of the remains of indigenous persons.&nbsp; This is partly because museums have inherited the possession of remains deposited in earlier times, and partly because their own standards have changed. &nbsp;Public decency and developing notions of the public interest have also played their part.&nbsp; The proportions of the countervailing interests, and the prevalence of one over another, depend in part upon the nature of the remains, their location and the relationships of petitioners.&nbsp; This paper will examine two classes of human remains, concentrating on their possible interrelationship, their association with the public domain at large, the rights of individuals connected to those remains and the varying degrees of intimacy between mortal relics and museums.&nbsp; It will emphasise the legal dimension, the pull of policy and principle, and the recent experience of European jurisdictions.&nbsp; The classes are

	Bone has a remarkable capacity to heal. However, in some instances the amount of bone which is needed to heal exceeds its healing capacity. These cases arise following accidents, infection or surgery to remove cancerous tissue and they result in the need to perform approximately 2.2 million surgical bone grafting procedures annually. These procedures have inherent disadvantages and so there is an urgent clinical need to develop a tissue engineering alternative to bone grafting.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Within this field Calori et al. 2011 have proposed that the healing of bone can be enhanced using what they coined the &lsquo;Diamond theory&rsquo; where they discuss the interconnecting role of the mechanical stability, vascularity, osteoprogenitor cells, growth factors and the scaffold in the healing of bone defects. Thus, to create a truly biomimicking scaffold all of these factors need to be addressed to some level if a tissue engineering approach is to succeed. While, growth factor treatments are clinically available in the form of Medtronics Infuse&reg; (Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2; BMP-2) and Strykers OP-1&reg; (BMP-7) they are currently applied as a two part system where the liquid growth factor is added to a collagen scaffold at supra-physiological doses for implantation. However, these scaffolds do little to retain the growth factor within the surgical site in the dynamic bleeding environment required to optimise healing and it has been reported that the collagen may actually affect the pharmacokinetics of the growth factor. Nevertheless, despite their limitations these treatments do enhance bone formation but this bone cannot survive without the supply of nutrients from the vascular bed and without this the bone will be resorbed.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In the current study a chitosan/hydroxyapatite composite scaffold is been developed to meet the requirements set out by Calori and overcome current issues with growth factor treatments. The mechanical stability of the scaffold has been optimised to maximise the mechanical stability of the construct whereas the issues of vascularity, growth factors and the response of host osteoprogenitor cells will be regulated through the sustained action of growth factors. To date scaffolds have been shown to be non-toxic pre-osteoblastic cell lines and they are capable of sustaining the release of a model protein for a minimum of 10 days. Work is continuing and data will soon be available in relation to the sustained release osteogenic and neovascular promoting growth factors alone and in combination.

	The mammalian gut has coexisted over millions of years in a symbiotic relationship with a vast and complex form of indigenous microbes. Gut flora host interactions are set early in life by a mother to offspring seed of ecology species at birth and a series of on-going complex and dynamic interactions with diet and lifestyle. This leads to a distinct microbiome developmental trajectory with age that massively influences host biochemistry and biological functions throughout life. Changes in the gut flora or dietary intake will immensely impose functional changes in organ function. The presentation will cover fundamental concepts of microbe-host interactions that impact on body function in early life. We will show that the problem that you encounter later in life, in regard to obesity and diabetes, may be set very early life. Works that has been and will be published from the EU-funded research project TORNADO are addressing these questions.

	Air pollution contains many toxicants known to affect neurological function and to have effects on the fetus in utero. Research into the association between in utero and early life exposure to air pollutants and risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is limited, but a few studies have suggested an increased risk for ASD with higher exposure to air pollutants. We explored this among children of mothers in the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study 2, a U.S. wide cohort of medically trained women. We first used U.S. Environmental Protection Agency modeled levels of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) to estimate exposures in the mother&rsquo;s census tract during the year of the child&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; Second, we used our validated and much higher resolution spatiotemporal model of particulate matter (PM) exposure that incorporates information from monitoring networks, meteorology, and a collection of geographic information system-based predictors to estimate maternal PM exposure at her residence before, during, and after the specific months of pregnancy.&nbsp; We found significantly elevated risk for autism spectrum disorders with higher exposure to several HAPs, including several metals, methylene chloride, and diesel particulate matter.&nbsp; In analyses of the more highly spatially and temporally resolved PM exposure data, we found significantly increased risk of ASD associated with PM<sub>2.5</sub> (PM &lt;2.5&micro;m in diameter) exposure during the specific months of pregnancy. &nbsp;There were weaker associations with PM<sub>10</sub> (PM &lt;10&micro;m in diameter).&nbsp; Associations with PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure 9 months before or after the pregnancy were substantially lower.&nbsp; These data provide strong support for the involvement of aspects of air pollution in the development of ASD.&nbsp; The accumulating evidence for such an association raises the possibility of interventions to reduce the burden of ASD and suggests that efforts to understand the biological pathways by which air pollutants may affect brain development are warranted.

	In Germany, diverse high-tech methods and tools for the detection and treatment of contaminants affecting drinking water quality are developed and commercialized. Products made in Germany have a high international reputation. They are thus not only utilized in the Western world but also exported to many less developed countries such as Bangladesh. The deployment of these, sometimes delicate, technologies in countries where infrastructural and financial means are lacking is challenging since they are often perceived as too expensive or too complicated to use. The genetically modified ARSOlux biosensor for arsenic in drinking water is an exception as it was specifically developed for implementation in large-scale field screenings in Bangladesh and other countries affected by arsenic contamination, having local challenges in mind. Regularly repeated arsenic &lsquo;blanket screenings&rsquo; with biosensors would enable governments and NGOs to monitor the drinking water quality of millions of people without large investments in infrastructure and material. Additionally no toxic wastes are created by using biosensor technology. A strategy and preparing steps for a sustainable market transfer in Bangladesh including an independent certification, testing and risk assessment of the biosensor in Germany are presented. The described certificates and reports should convince local stakeholders and the government to use the biosensor technology in Bangladesh.

<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Our interest in biomedical science, however, isn't limited to research: we also think it is critical that society at large can engage with and discuss advances in biomedicine and their implications for us all. To that effect, we strive to promote public engagement with science, and its place in national and international conversation.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Compelling science writing that explains research and sets it in context for a general audience is a critical part of those conversations, but has faced increasing challenges as the mainstream media struggles to find sustainable business models in the face of the digital revolution. Many newspapers have cut back on science coverage, particularly the long-form feature material that is often best at exploring science in full detail.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">But while digital has challenged traditional media, it has also created opportunities for new players. The Wellcome Trust is embracing these through the imminent launch of a new digital publication, Mosaic, which will publish long-form features about biomedical science and its impact on society. The aim will be to get behind subjects and explore them from different angles, and we are commissioning the best freelance writers we can find to do it. The features we publish won't be limited to Wellcome Trust funded research, but will encompass the most interesting conteporary stories in bioscience wherever they are.

	What assumptions underlie the pairing of discovery with innovation in contemporary discourse about science?&nbsp; It appears that everyone is excited about <i>translational research</i>. And yet translational research is not easily defined, and the relationship between idea and application, or bench and bedside, or discovery and innovation is poorly understood. What is clear is that we all want &lsquo;results&rsquo; from investments in research and development. But what results? We all want translational research to generate &lsquo;impacts&rsquo;. But which impacts? Scholars of science and science policy have noted that a new social contract is emerging for how science &ndash; especially biomedical science &ndash; works in the contemporary world. Biomedical scientists, whether they like it or not, must promise specific results early in the research process, must produce results sooner and not later, and must promote their results so as to assist in the &lsquo;translation&rsquo; of basic research into outcomes. But which outcomes matter, or should matter? Of course, the very idea of translating research into results is not a new one; indeed, it may be coextensive with the history of biomedical research. But it is increasingly recognized that translation is neither easy nor inevitable, that the tangible results of biomedical research are difficult to discern, and yet that results are critically important in order to justify continued investment in research. The supposed pipeline from discovery to innovation is a pipedream. This presentation provides a historical and philosophical perspective on various assumptions underlying the connection between discovery and innovation, and on how these assumptions enable (and&nbsp;constrain) science progress.

That is, relative losers abound. In the U.S., sprawl reduces employment opportunities for lower-skill workers and women, dampens the economic mobility prospects of the poor, and generates negative environmental externalities.

	The health of an individual animal is the result of complex interactions among immune status, body condition, disease agent pathogenicity / toxicity, and environmental conditions. Population health status is affected by these factors but assessed in a different manner. Climate change will affect these interactions in several ways including direct effects due to loss of the sea ice, elevations of water and air temperature, changes in levels of ozone and increased occurrence of severe weather. Indirect effects of climate change on animal health include alterations in pathogen &nbsp;presence, abundance and transmission pathways, changes in body condition and nutrient availability due to shifts in the prey base, changes in toxin and environmental contaminant exposures, and adverse effects of increased human habitation in the Arctic such as, chemical and pathogen pollution due to run-off, increased ship traffic with the attendant increased risks of ship strike, oil spills, introduction of invasive species through ballast, and possibly acoustic injury.&nbsp; Since few talks focus on the changes that will and are occurring with pathogen transmission and biotoxins exposures, this talk with focus on this aspect of climate change effects. Alterations in disease transmission and prevalence are already attributed to climate change due to vector and host range extensions, changes in host densities, and increased survival of pathogens.&nbsp; Emergence and consequences of harmful algal blooms are recognized throughout the world, with significant impacts documented in marine mammals. Climate changes can result in increased micronutrients run off of from the land and airborne deposits due to desertification, increased water temperature and decreased salinity, all of which may contribute to the increase in harmful algal blooms.&nbsp; The extent to which climate change will impact marine mammal health will vary among species, with some species more sensitive to these factors than others and perhaps some benefiting from the predicted changes. Current baseline data on marine mammal health along with matching data on population trends and climate changes are needed.

	The repatriation of human remains from western museums back to their communities of origin is often presented as a symbolizing a fundamental dichotomy between the scientific research and the claimant communities with regard to the manner in which these remains are valued, across which little other than a common and intense interest in them exists. Examples of&nbsp; insensitivity, misunderstanding, and stereotyping by both sides pepper the history of interactions between these groups. Nevertheless, both groups share a larger number of common interests than is often appreciated. These include interests in the light these remains can shed &mdash; tangibly and symbolically &mdash; on the origins, history and cultural practices of the groups they represent, the manner in which they can be used&nbsp; &mdash; tangibly and symbolically &mdash; to educate young people about human history, and the evidence they provide of the common humanity of all people across vast spans of time and space. At The Natural History Museum (London) we have, over the past decade, been deeply engaged in a process of institution-wide constructive engagement with indigenous communities over these issues. It has been our experience that, with education, understanding, and goodwill on both sides, it is possible to bridge the perceived interest gap and develop respectful approaches to human remains access management that satisfies the needs of both communities. These approaches have taken different forms in different cases, but together they span the gamut from full repatriation and surrender of all administrative duties to claimant communities to retention, by mutual agreement, of a larger part of the collections belonging to particular communities to a community-sanctioned commitment to increase the amount of scientific research performed on these collections, in some cases with the active participation of individuals from the owner communities. It is our belief that this process of direct and constructive engagement represents a viable (if not the only) process by which both communities can attain the full and legitimate aspirations. Moreover, we see the products of this approach operating in the repatriation and scientific research programmes of many other institutions. The time has now come to&nbsp; shift the emphasis of human remains repatriation and research work from a focus on ownership to one of engagement and collaboration based on mutual understanding of, and respect for, the valuable contribution both communities&rsquo; shared interest in these remains can make to their preservation, study and veneration.

	The European Research Council (ERC) is a pan-European funding organisation that aims to stimulate scientific excellence in Europe. With its bottom-up approach which allows top researchers from all over the world and from any field of research, to compete in its calls, the ERC has set precedence in the European Research Area. Excellence is the sole criterion for selection in ERC competitions; there are neither thematic priorities nor geographical quotas for funding. Through substantial grants, it encourages pioneering ideas in new and emerging fields of research and introduces unconventional and innovative thinking. This presentation will focus on the unique role of the ERC, and will address its wider impact and its future challenges. The ERC has an ambition to support the science that goes beyond the existing boundaries; through multidisciplinary research teams that bring together scientists from all continents. Funding first rate scientists to perform high-risk/high-gain research at the frontiers of knowledge is pivotal to foster Europe&rsquo;s innovation and tackle various societal challenges under the new EU research programme &ldquo;<i>Horizon 2020&rdquo;.</i>

To achieve such challenging goals, scientific discovery must not only advance in the laboratory but also transition into everyday practice, a challenge that cannot be overestimated.&nbsp; New preventions/therapies must be applied reproducibly and systematically, with flexibility to adapt locally. At least five elements will required for success: 1) Fundamental scientific advances that generate effective therapies for high human health impact diseases; 2) Calls that will mobilize the public and the political leadership to action; 3) Global champions with fiscal resources to support the effort; 4) Adequate public health infrastructure and capacity; 5) Public private partnerships to maximize the resources and approaches to the problem.&nbsp; Progress is critically dependent on a combination of factors, including political will, economic resources, diagnostic technology, manufacturing capacity, clinical infrastructure, and health care delivery systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of HIV-AIDS, global drug treatment has markedly advanced through PEPFAR, and calls for more comprehensive action have been issued [3,4].&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet two years after the pivotal studies were published, progress has been alarmingly slow; insufficient and not at scale.&nbsp; Systemic solutions are needed to ensure that the fruits of scientific investigation accrue benefits to the citizens of the world.</b></span></span></span><br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">

	Living in a closely connected and highly mobile world presents many new mechanisms for rapid disease spread and in recent years, global disease surveillance has become a high priority. The National Strategy for Biosurveillance defines biosurveillance as &ldquo;the process of gathering, integrating, interpreting, and communicating essential information related to all-hazards threats or disease activity affecting human, animal, or plant health to achieve early detection and warning, contribute to overall situational awareness of the health aspects of an incident, and to enable better decision-making at all levels.&rdquo; However, the strategy does not specify how &ldquo;essential information&rdquo; is to be identified and integrated into the current biosurveillance enterprise, or what metrics qualify information as being &ldquo;essential&rdquo;. The question of data stream identification and selection requires structured methods that can systematically evaluate the tradeoffs between the many criteria that need to be taken in account. LANL has developed a formalized decision support analytic framework that can facilitate identification of &ldquo;essential information&rdquo; for use in biosurveillance systems or processes and we offer this framework to the global BSV community as a tool for optimizing the BSV enterprise. &nbsp;An overview of our framework and associated evaluation methods will be presented, together with results of data stream evaluation, which facilitates the identification of a defensible set of options for decision makers to use to prepare for and mitigate the spread of disease. &nbsp;&nbsp;

	Observations at submillimeter/millimeter (submm/mm) wavelengths (~0.25-1.4 mm) provide a unique view of galaxy formation, revealing galaxies in the early Universe (~1 Gyr after the Big Bang) that cannot be seen at optical wavelengths due to extreme dust obscuration. These submm/mm-selected galaxies (SMGs) pose a challenge to our models of galaxy evolution. Current surveys from single-dish telescopes are sensitive to only the most extreme galaxies forming stars &gt;100 times the rate of the Milky Way, while the more typical galaxies that contribute ~80% to the total energy budget at these wavelengths remain elusive. I will discuss recent large area surveys of SMGs, and what they reveal about the formation of the massive galaxies and how they evolve over cosmic time. I will also talk about the potential for the next generation of submm/mm wavelength telescopes - including the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) - to resolve some of the major challenges to understanding the nature these dust-obscured galaxies.

	In U.S. presidential elections, it seems, voters who do not live in competitive states, in which<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">either major-party candidate might win, do not count, because as individuals they cannot<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">influence the outcome in their states. Therefore, it would appear, they have zero voting power, as<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">measured, for example, by the Banzhaf index of voting power.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">But noncompetitive states do influence the outcome, because their electoral votes are essential to<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">a candidate's victory. We resolve the paradox of how a noncompetitive state can influence the<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">outcome, even though its voters have no voting power, by showing how their votes in these states<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">set up the contest in the competitive states.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In the 2012 election, for example, the nine states considered competitive collectively had 110 of<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">the 538 electoral votes. But the contest gave Barack Obama a big head start, because he needed<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">only 33 of the 110 electoral votes to win, whereas Mitt Romney needed 79. This is because,<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">going into the election, the 42 noncompetitive states (counting Washington, DC, as one) gave<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Obama a lead over Romney of 237 to 191 electoral votes, so there were many more ways that<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Obama could win a majority of 270 electoral votes than Romney could.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">In many of Obama's winning coalitions, no competitive state &ndash; including the largest, Florida &ndash;<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">could change the outcome by changing its vote, whereas this was not the case in almost all<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Romney's winning coalitions, making them much more vulnerable. We measure the power of the<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">noncompetitive states, especially for Obama, by his relative likelihood of winning, as well as the<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">relative invulnerability of his winning coalitions, which can be attributed to the lead he enjoyed<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">in these states. Thus, the noncompetitive states count, but they exercise power in a different way<br /="/" style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">from the competitive states.

	Despite being in the midst of a "Great Recession," the first Obama administration dramatically increased science and technology investment and elevated science in policy-making. This acted as a carrier-wave for science globally. The second Obama administration may yet shift gear and funding may decline. Regardless, international cooperation in science and technology has gained renewed prominence as a tool for bettering relations with the world, as well as addressing the most urgent global challenges. Building on the insights of previous speakers, this talk will examine whether the development of a truly global scientific enterprise is within reach and assess the obstacles that have yet to be confronted. How should we incorporate rising scientific communities such as China and Africa into the currently Western-oriented scientific structure? How can we cooperate while competing for scarce international resources, evidenced by the newfound scramble for Africa? How can we address explosive tensions between scientific information and societal and political directions? All governments and regions face new challenges in terms of how science is viewed and used. Attitudes and perceptions about science, ranging from issues at the nexus of religion and politics, and competitiveness and immigration, may sometimes seem irreconcilable with science-based progress.

The emergence of new global challenges from cross-border energy supply, preventable diseases linked to lifestyle, shifting geo-political environments, and the linkages between health and ageing, trade, intellectual property, and human rights, present stakeholders with a complex matrix of technical and relational challenges. Due to the impact of globalisation on science, however, a new type of diplomacy and dialogue is necessary to navigate the changing landscape of international affairs and politics. As economic progress in every community worldwide has become interdependent with advances in science and technology, science diplomacy is increasingly the chosen method of interaction between stakeholders. At the same time, it is imperative that we work in ways that are transparent and open to a diversity of contributors and ideas. Assessing risk versus benefit in adopting an innovation is complex and depends upon an open dialogue. Only then will we realize the promise of furthering scientific discovery and innovation to meet pressing global challenges and improve quality of life.

The Netïflix data is derived from millions of Netïflix users, who have an incentive to report sincere preferences, unlike random survey-takers.
Using these elections, we investigate theoretically-possible phenomena, including different voting rules yielding different winners, and the possibility of irrational aggregated preferences. We investigate the occurrence of statistical patterns of interest, such as single- peakedness. In addition, we look at the practical manipulability of elections according to several recently-proposed manipulation algorithms.

	Large-scale physics experiments generate huge quantities of data.&nbsp; As an example, the US Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) will produce 1 petabyte (=10<sup>15</sup> bytes) of data per year when it comes online in 2015.&nbsp; The Large Hadron Collider currently generates approximately 25 times that amount now.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">&nbsp;The storage, reduction, and analysis of these complex data sets have typically carried out by large teams of &lsquo;insiders&rsquo;; expert scientists who belong to collaborations organized around the production of scientific results. &nbsp;In the past few years however, there has been a strong movement to broaden access to large-scale physics data in the US driven both by &lsquo;top down&rsquo; pressure (i.e., federal agency policies) and &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; pressure (i.e., &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; researchers who want to access to data for their own research interests).
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">By and large the movement toward broader access is a positive one, but one that requires care in implementation.&nbsp; Providing open access to large complex data sets is neither easy nor inexpensive.&nbsp; It requires technical effort (in long term curation, data reduction and associated metadata production, data delivery in commonly used data formats, software to read and visualize the data, and associated documentation) as well as an understanding of the needs of the broader research community. There are cultural barriers to overcome (&lsquo;It&rsquo;s my data, why should I have to give it to you?&rsquo;) as well as implications for intellectual property rights of the data producers.

	In 1966, Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which provided the public with unprecedented access to stores of government data.&nbsp; Many states later followed suit, and enacted their own statutory schemes to permit broad-based data accessibility.&nbsp; The open-government architecture that resulted has become a fundamental tool of the press, policy makers, academics, and the public.&nbsp; It has enabled reportage, scientific analysis, historical research, government oversight, and policy formulation.&nbsp;
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Despite the existence of sophisticated public information mechanisms, ready access to government data remains elusive in certain circumstances, and several trends are exerting pressure on the nation&rsquo;s open-government infrastructure.&nbsp; Such trends include the increased use of security claims as a basis for withholding previously public data, increasing agency non-compliance with statutory mandates, recalcitrance on the part of private contractors who hold government data subject to disclosure under public records laws, and a reduction in funding for open government compliance.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">An examination of contemporary case studies demonstrates the impact of these trends on government data architectures. An analysis of specific responses to the trends at work in the case studies &ndash; ranging from statutory adjustments to court rulings &ndash; provides insights into how the nation&rsquo;s open government architecture may be buttressed or reinvigorated to face current challenges.&nbsp; Specific tools for acquiring government data in the face of agency non-compliance are identified and discussed within the context of current trends.

	The most serious threat to global sustainability is one on which there is widespread agreement: the growing difficulty of avoiding large-scale famines. Measures to improve food security have never been more urgently needed, and sadly current warnings probably underestimate the food problem. For example, in addition to nearly a billion people &ldquo;hungry,&rdquo; micronutrient deficiencies may afflict some 2 billion additional people today. And many other sources of vulnerability are underrated: the potential impact of climate disruption on farming and fisheries; how a shift away from fossil-fuel consumption will impair food production; how agriculture itself, a major emitter of greenhouse gases, accelerates climate change; and the consequences of groundwater overpumping and the progressive deterioration of soils. Indeed, agriculture is also a leading cause of biodiversity loss &ndash; and thus loss of vital ecosystem services supplied to farming &ndash; as well as being a principal source of global toxification.
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Perhaps most important, virtually all discussions of food security assume the human population will grow by 2.5 billion people by 2050. The optimism of many analysts concerning our ability to feed these additional billions is quite disturbing, given the dreadful nutritional state of billions today. If it will be so easy to feed a population 35 percent larger, why isn&rsquo;t everyone well-nourished now?
<br style="mso-data-placement: same-cell;">Five steps have long been recommended to solve the food problem: stop increasing land for agriculture (to preserve natural ecosystem services); raise yields where possible; increase the efficiency of fertilizer, water and energy use; become more vegetarian; and reduce food wastage. To this one could add: reduce the flow of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere; stop wrecking the oceans; greatly enlarge investment in agricultural research; and move proper nutrition for all to the top of the global policy agenda.&nbsp; All of these steps require substantial changes in human behavior, but they seem unlikely since most people fail to understand the agricultural system and its complex, nonlinear connections to the mechanisms driving environmental deterioration. Inputs needed to feed each additional person will, on average, come from scarcer, poorer and more distant sources, disproportionately more energy will be used and greenhouse gases generated.&nbsp; And above all they fail to see that humanely reducing future human numbers, by empowering women everywhere and making modern contraception universally available, could make solutions much easier and the human future much brighter.

	Increasing population, rising affluence, changing diets, and increasing consumption are placing unprecedented demands on the world's agriculture and natural resources. Today, approximately a billion people are chronically malnourished while our agricultural systems are concurrently degrading land, water, biodiversity and climate across regional and global scales. To meet the world’s future food security and sustainability needs, food production systems must grow substantially while, at the same time, agriculture’s environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. In this presentation, we will discuss potential solutions to this multi-faceted dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by targeting key strategic levers linked to deforestation, yield gaps, efficiency, diets, biofuels and food waste.

	The most drought resistant among the five most important cereal crops and a key dual-use (grain and biomass) crop in regions containing some of the world&rsquo;s most degraded soils, the importance of sorghum might be further elevated by the development of productive genotypes that increase the extent and duration of soil cover beyond those of conventional annual crops, <i>mitigating or even reversing losses of ecological capital through multiple crops from single plantings. </i>Ratoon or perennial grain crops may provide smallholders in particular with additional tools that can support their hard-won agricultural skills to feed their families despite the challenges of climate change and soil degradation -- deeper roots and longer growing periods mean more harvests, better protected soil and more resilience to fluctuations in rainfall.&nbsp;Ratoon cropping is routine in closely related sugarcane and is occasionally practiced with some sorghum genotypes, however little attention has been given to systematic improvement of sorghum for this production system. Spreading seed and soil preparation/sowing costs over multiple cropping cycles may significantly change production economics, perhaps permitting smallholders to broaden utilization of hybrids to further increase productivity. Modern genomics tools, particularly useful for improving perennial crops, can speed the process from lab to field.&nbsp;The <i>Sorghum</i> genus has become a model for dissecting the molecular control of perenniality, and rich resources are being developed to link sorghum biodiversity to its molecular basis. Nature has made sorghum perennial at least twice, and crosses between wild perennials and cultivated sorghums show the feasibility of developing genotypes with varying degrees of investment in perenniality while still providing harvestable food, feed, sugar and/or cellulose.&nbsp; Genetic analysis of progeny from these crosses reveals &lsquo;quantitative trait loci&rsquo; (QTLs) conferring traits related to ratooning and perenniality, and provides diagnostic DNA markers. One perennial <i>Sorghum</i> species has adapted to continents and latitudes far beyond the reach of its progenitors, surviving stresses year after year that are only periodically experienced by conventional (annual) sorghum, and we are also exploring the hypothesis that that it harbors novel alleles that may mitigate production challenges in conventional annual sorghums.

	Agricultural systems are dependent upon the natural resources because they use these components, e.g., water, air, solar radiation, as part of the growth process. The primary natural resource base upon which agriculture is built is the soil resource which supplies water and nutrients. We assume that we can manage this resource by supplying water and nutrients to the soil and agriculture has readily adopted technologies which supply irrigation water and inorganic nutrients to meet crop demands. However, adopting these practices coupled with more intense tillage and lack of residue cover left on the soil from previous crops has contributed to soil degradation. Soil degradation is most often observed in reduced soil organic matter and increased erosion and both of these factors contribute to loss of soil productivity. The soil resource is a critical component in resilience of agricultural system to climate change but the linkage to direct changes in the soil resource often goes unnoticed. Examination of the variation in crop yields across a typical agricultural field reveals the impact of climate stresses on productivity in all but the most optimal growing conditions.&nbsp; The degraded areas of the field show the largest yield losses when subjected to any level of crop stress and if we extend those impacts to future climates and increased soil degradation the result would be greater variation in crop production.&nbsp; The goal of future agricultural systems should be to become as efficient as possible in the use of water, capture of solar radiation, and use of nutrients. To achieve this goal will require a renewed understanding of the importance of the natural resource supporting agriculture and begin to realize the value of enhancing and maintaining the quality of the natural resource base.

</td><td>7335</td></tr><tr><td>Seminars</td><td>12032</td><td>Some Simple Economics for Early Stage Drug Development</td><td> 

	There are three key elements of investment decisions in early stage drug development programs: (1) the nature of the risks at different stages; (2) the probabilities associated with those risks; and (3) the associated discount rates or opportunity costs of capital appropriate for those risks. There are two unrelated types of risk in early stage drug development: the technical risks associated with success and failure at each stage of development or clinical testing and the valuation risks associated with the prospects for the drug should it survive the development and testing process. Technical risks depend on outcomes in the development process and clinical trials and thus are unrelated to market conditions. Simple economic reasoning suggests that the appropriate discount rate is thus the riskless rate for such risks. Valuation risk could impinge on early stage market value assessments if market conditions strongly affected them and if costs could substantially exceed them but neither circumstance is likely, leaving valuation risk with virtually no impact on early stage investment decisions. Late stage valuation risk does involve market conditions, although probably less than that implicit in the opportunity costs of capital of large pharma because the impact of market conditions on the risk of managing approved drugs exceeds that of developing drugs. Taken together, this reasoning suggests that the present value of costs is higher than typically thought since the riskless rate is lower than the typically assumed opportunity cost of capital but that the present value of a successful drug is higher because the assumed discount factor is typically too high as well. The analysis also suggests that the trend toward prepackaged structured exits with contractual milestones serves to shift valuation risk away from early stage drug developers to large pharma and biotech, which is probably their comparative advantage. Hence, early stage drug development projects with prenegotiated prepackaged exits based on contractual milestones should have prospective costs and revenues discounted at the riskless rate, which is far from current practice. The reason is likely investor and managerial suspicion about projected costs and revenues and expectations about the probability of success and failure. As is the case with corporate finance in general, better decision making would result from use of the correct opportunity cost of capital coupled with realistic and unbiased projections.

	Urban computing is a process of acquiring, integrating, and analyzing heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, devices, vehicles, buildings, and human, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g. air pollution, increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. Urban computing connects unobtrusive and ubiquitous sensing technologies, advanced data management and analytics models, and novel visualization methods, to create win-win-win solutions that improve urban environment, human life quality, and city operation systems. In this talk, we will present our recent research into urban computing, introducing the applications and technologies for integrating and deep mining heterogeneous data. Examples include large-scale dynamic ridesharing, identifying different functional regions (e.g., residential and commercial areas) in urban spaces, and fine-grained air quality inference throughout a city.
