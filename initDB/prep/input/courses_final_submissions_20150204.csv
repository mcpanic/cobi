Our target audience consists of those who are \ interested in starting projects relating to music technology. Those with \ a general interest are also welcome. Participants will learn key aspects \ of the theory and practice of musical interface design by studying case \ studies and practical know-how sourced mainly from the leading conference \ in this area, known as ""New Interfaces for Musical Expression"" or NIME. \ Advances in digital audio technologies have led to a situation where \ computers play a role in most music production and performance. Digital \ technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for the creation and \ manipulation of sound, however the flexibility of these new technologies \ implies a confusing array of choices for musical composers and \ performers. Some artists have faced this challenge by using computers \ directly to create music. However, most would agree that the computer is \ not a musical instrument, in the same sense as traditional instruments, \ and it is natural to ask ""how to play the computer"" using interface \ technology appropriate for human brains and bodies. In two eighty minute \ sessions we will introduce an approach to the design of musical \ interfaces. The first session is presented in lecture format with many \ video demonstrations of musical interfaces. The second session \ illustrates the design and prototyping process with case studies, and \ continues with live demonstrations of hardware and software tools used \ for musical interface projects. The course concludes with a group design \ exercise in which attendees will sketch their original ideas for new \ musical interfaces. The course is aimed at beginners but more experienced \ participants will have plenty to explore. Familiarity with basic aspects \ of interactive media will be helpful, however there are no specific \ technical prerequisites.

After giving a brief overview of what ESM is and the history, we will discuss best practices for study design including when ESM is appropriate, considerations for ensuring validity and reliability, and guidance for signal scheduling. We will introduce the PACO app (www.pacoapp.com) for conducting ESM studies on mobile devices and conduct a demonstration of how to use the tool. To better understand how to conduct a large-scale ESM study, we will discuss one such study the Google Search User Experience Research team conducted with 1200 participants across the US. We will then walk attendees through each step of the process to conduct a successful ESM study, including creating the data collection form, recruiting recommendations, participant instructions, incentive recommendations, participant retention, and participation monitoring. Next will be a discussion of how to analyze data from an ESM study. In the last portion of the class, attendees will pair up to design their own ESM study, build it in PACO, and launch it to themselves to test. This hands-on exercise will ensure everyone has the skills upon leaving the class to build their own studies.","Attendees will obtain the skills to design, conduct, and analyze data from an ESM study in order to capture a deeper, more holistic understanding of their users.","early release","FormatComplete","","","","","","","Jan  9 21:05",""

While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research.

In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design doesn’t mean it will automatically be accepted or get to market. By definition, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have anti-innovation antibodies [1] that often kill new ideas [2]—even disruptive innovations [3] that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need new tools to meet this challenge—tools that empower UX teams in both business and universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs—a design-led, facilitative, cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who systemically identify new ideas, and align multi-disciplinary teams around their ideas. Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping. Learn how innovative companies and universities, such as Splunk, Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, the Berlin Technical University, Yahoo!, Mindjet, zSpace, HP, and more identify, design, and bring great products to market.","[1] Nieters, J. and Thompson, C.

In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design doesn’t mean it will automatically be accepted or get to market. By definition, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have anti-innovation antibodies that often kill new ideas—even disruptive innovations that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need new tools to meet this challenge—tools that empower UX teams in both business and universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs—a design-led, facilitative, cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who systemically identify new ideas, and align multi-disciplinary teams around their ideas. Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping. Learn how innovative companies and universities, such as Splunk, Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, the Berlin Technical University, Yahoo!, Mindjet, zSpace, HP, and more identify, design, and bring great products to market.","Rapid design labs are a design-led, cross-functional approach to innovation that enables attendees to identify innovations and align multi-disciplinary teams.
