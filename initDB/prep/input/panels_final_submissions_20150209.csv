Chilana","pchilana@uwaterloo.ca","There has been a longstanding concern within HCI that even though we are accumulating great innovations in the field, we rarely see these innovations develop into products. Our panel brings together HCI researchers from academia and industry who have been directly involved in technology transfer of one or more HCI innovations. They will share their experiences around what it takes to transition an HCI innovation from the lab to the market, including issues around time commitment, funding, resources, and business expertise. More importantly, our panelists will discuss and debate the tensions that we (researchers) face in choosing design and evaluation methods that help us make an HCI research contribution versus what actually matters when we go to market.

After we receive final confirmation, we will start advertising the panel and solicit additional questions from the community (a number of HCI researchers have expressed their enthusiasm for this topic and the questions they would like to see addressed). \  \ 2) We recruited two female panelists, Mary Czerwinski from MSR and Ranjitha Kumar from UIUC/Stanford (moderator is also a female). (We will update the submission with Ranjitha's information before Feb 1). We appreciate the committee encouraging us to strike a balance, but unfortunately, one of the big issues with tech transfer is that there is a lack of female involvement. \  \  \ 3) As for international perspective, our panelist Tapan Parikh will be sharing his experience in pursuing tech transfer in developing countries, such as India. We reached out to a few other researchers outside North America, but have not received a confirmed yes for participation. (Patrick Baudisch from HPI, Germany has agreed to be on the panel, but cannot confirm attendance before the panel deadline. We will have him as an informal panelist if he is present at CHI). \  \ We hope that our panel this year will be a starting point for these discussions and in future years, we will be able to have a workshop or another panel that is dedicated to tech transfer issues from a global perspective. \  \ Thanks for your consideration.","early release","","","","","","","","","Feb  1 17:00",""
