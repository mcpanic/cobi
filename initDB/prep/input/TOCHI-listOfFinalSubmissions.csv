These significant observations are displayed in a mobile application using natural language, for example, “You are happier on days when you sleep more.” We performed a pilot study, made improvements to the system, and then conducted a 90-day trial with 60 diverse participants, learning that interactions between wellbeing and context are highly individual and that our system supported an increased self-understanding that lead to focused behavior changes.","Health; Context; Mobile; Wellbeing; Mashups; Quantified Self","","We present a 90 day, 60 user field study of the Health Mashups system – demonstrating that understanding long-term correlations between wellbeing data and context helped participants make positive behavior changes.","","Frank Bentley","Konrad Tollmar","earlyrelease","","Oct  6 21:12",""

However, deploying and maintaining display systems “in the wild” that can support communities is challenging. Based on the authors’ experiences in designing and fielding a diverse range of community- supporting public display deployments, we identify a large set of challenges and issues that researchers working in this area are likely to encounter. Grouping them into five distinct layers – (1) hardware, (2) system architecture, (3) content, (4) system interaction, and (5) community interaction design – we draw up the P-LAYERS framework to enable a more systematic appreciation of the diverse range of issues associated with the development, the deployment, and the maintenance of such systems. Using three of our own deployments as illustrative examples, we will describe both our experiences within each individual layer, as well as point out interactions between the layers. We believe our framework provides a valuable aid for researchers looking to work in this space, alerting them to the issues they are likely to encounter during their deployments, and help them plan accordingly.","Community interaction; public displays; pervasive displays; community needs","","Based on three ""in the wild"" deployments of interactive public display systems that support community interaction we draw the P-LAYERS framework that informs the design of such systems.","","Nemanja Memarovic","Florian Alt","","","Oct  7 08:52",""

We describe links between walking, sociality, and using resources in a case study of community-based, solar, cellphone charging in villages in South Africa’s Eastern Cape. Like 360 million rural Africans, inhabitants of these villages are poor and, like 25% and 92% of the world, respectively, do not have domestic electricity or own motor vehicles. We describe nine practices in using the charging stations we deployed. We recorded 700 people using the stations, over a year, some regularly. We suggest that the way we frame practices limits insights about them, and consider various routines in using and sharing local resources to discover relations that might also feature in charging. Specifically, walking interconnects routines in using, storing, sharing and sustaining resources, and contributes to knowing, feeling, wanting and avoiding as well as to different aspects of sociality, social order and perspectives on sustainability. Along the way, bodies acquire literacies that make certain relationalities legible. Our study shows we cannot assert what sustainable practice means a priori and, further, that detaching practices from bodies and their paths limits solutions, at least in rural Africa. Thus, we advocate a more “alongly” integrated approach to data about practices.","Sustainability; Solar; Walking; Embodiment; Topokinesis; rural; Africa ","","A prolonged, deep study in rural Africa showing how everyday bodily routines inﬂect technology use and that the way we frame practices around technology can limit our insights about interactions.","hci4d, IxSc, cultures","Nicola J Bidwell","Simon Robinson","earlyrelease","","Oct 10 05:29",""

We organize these reflections around five overlapping themes: visibility of community actors, crea-tion of community information infrastructures, the role of place-based identity and activity in community, the effectiveness of participatory relationships, and the research designs and methods appropriate. We frame these reflections around a conceptual model of community, and the suggestion that the local com-munity can be a living laboratory for HCI in the wild.","Community informatics; Participatory design research; Turn to the wild","","HCI can “turn to the wild” but still stay home.

Safety-critical environments, such as driving, aggravate the need for a more nuanced understanding of interfaces that may reconcile conflicting tasks. Speech interfaces are prime examples of such interfaces. In this article, we investigate how design variations of an in-vehicle speech interface influence performance of a primary task (driving safely) and a secondary task (e-mailing). In a controlled experiment, we test the performance implications of using single computer-generated Text-To- Speech (TTS) voice and multiple matching TTS voices while users respond to e-mails with varying levels of complexity during driving. Our results indicate that the number of voices used has a significant effect on both driving performance and handling e-mail–related activities. We discuss potentially unintended consequences of making the interface too naturalistic and too engaging for the driver and conclude with theoretical and practical implications.","interface design; in-vehicle speech interfaces; driving; e-mailing; distraction; driving simulator; text-to-speech; multiple voices; text complexity; task prioritization; user engagement","","","IxSc","Michael Schermann","Helmut Krcmar","earlyrelease","","Dec  3 17:09",""
