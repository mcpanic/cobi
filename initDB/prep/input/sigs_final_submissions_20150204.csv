But little is known about how to design software in a gender-aware fashion, and existing research on gender differences relevant to software design is scattered across at least five different academic fields (e.g., psychology, computer science, education, communications, and women's studies).  This research SIG will bring together female and male academics, industry researchers, and practitioners with three goals in mind: (1) to build community across research/practice boundaries; (2) to pool our knowledge on promising practices for design and evaluation of software from a gender perspective; and (3) to begin to build a shared, on-line research and literature base to support solid, well-informed progress on this important issue.","WARNING: These references are very long: 7, 24.
