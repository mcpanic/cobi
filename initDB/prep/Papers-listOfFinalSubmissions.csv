Smarties allows wall application developers to easily add interactive support to their collaborative applications. It consists of an interface running on touch mobile devices for input, a communication protocol between devices and the wall, and a library that implements the protocol and handles synchronization, locking and input conflicts. The library presents the input as an event loop with callback functions. Each touch mobile has  multiple cursor controllers, each associated with keyboards, widgets and clipboards. These controllers can be assigned to specific tasks, are persistent in nature, and can be shared by multiple collaborating users for sharing work. They can control simple cursors on the wall application, or specific content (objects or groups of them). The types of  associated widgets are decided by the wall application, making the mobile interface customizable by the wall application it connects to.",Paper,Olivier Chapuis,chapuis@lri.fr,"1.

Given a visual scene, the system dynamically biases its language model based on the content of the visual scene and visual attention of the speaker. Visual attention is used to focus on likely objects within the scene. Given a spoken description the system then uses the visually biased language model to process the speech. The system uses head pose as a proxy for the visual attention of the speaker. Readily available standard computer vision algorithms are used to recognize the objects in the scene and automatic real time head pose estimation is done using depth data captured via a Microsoft Kinect. The system was evaluated on multiple participants. Overall, incorporating visual information into the speech recognizer greatly improved speech recognition accuracy. The rapidly decreasing cost of 3D sensing technologies such as the Kinect allows systems with similar underlying principles to be used for many speech recognition tasks where there is visual information.",Note,Soroush Vosoughi,soroush@mit.edu,"1.

For a long time, information was scarce and therefore valuable. While, the explosion of digital information has made information plentiful, time to read and process that content is now scarce. This problem is only exacerbated by our increased mobility, and the expectation to be â€œon topâ€ù of the continuous barrage of documents while on the go. Knowledge workers in enterprise need solutions that are designed with quick methods for finding what to read in a large collection of documents (e.g. financial reports, legal documents, news), and ways of presenting it within small visual real estate. Unlike reviews, document collections are long, more varied, and context is extremely important. In response, we present Odin, a mobile web-based window onto a userâ€™s document corpus. Rather than performing corpus summarization, Odin users can quickly find opinions and documents that are Aligned or Divergent from the corpusâ€™ consensus, or those that are the most Relevant given the overall corpusâ€™ of opinions. Odin presents this information through a simple and intuitive mobile interface. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first UI/system (and support algorithm) to allow mobile users to place documents and their opinions in context through alignment rather than raw word count or sentiment.

We used live theatre as a way to engage small groups of participants in dialogues around the design of NetCarers, to qualify their contributions in a refined performance, and to communicate their concerns and aspirations to domain experts.

We detail the process and reflect on the methodâ€™s qualities.,"INTRODUCTION (p1): \ - We have emphasized in the introduction (p1) the relevancy of EDT has for HCI. We have also reiterated that the primary focus of this paper is on exploring the qualities of live theatre and outlining the process of developing workshop content, how live and improvised theatre was used and how it supported participant contributions. We have also detailed more explicitly the system requirements that emerged in the reflective discussion at the end of the paper (see comments below). \  \ LITERATURE (p1-2): \ - In the FROM SCENARIOS TO FILM AND THEATRE section we have reduced the amount of discussion of scenarios and film in favour of giving more space to the work related to the use of theatre in HCI. We have given more detail about Boalâ€™s Theatre of the Oppressed and Forum Theatre technique and why this has been influential in HCI. \  \ - On p2 we have also referenced Laurelâ€™s prior work in two ways: as foundational to the understanding the role of performativity in how human and technological activity/interaction; and as a core example of using improv techniques in the design process. \  \ EDT DESCRIPTION (p3-5): \ - We have included a short overview of all of the 5 phases of EDT on p3. \  \ - On p3 (â€œPhase 1: Definition of situations and â€˜starting scenesâ€™â€ù) we have detailed how our initial starting scenes were informed by the anecdotal evidence of our project partners. \  \ - We have clarified what the backgrounds and expertise of the theatre director an actors were on p3-4 (backgrounds in socially engaged theatre practice and extensive experience of workshop facilitation).   \  \ - Throughout the detailed descriptions of the phases we have explicitly mentioned the relationships each of the individual â€œphasesâ€ù of EDT have to the three issues introduced at the start of the paper (exploring future scenarios, prototyping experiences and understanding peopleâ€™s lived experiences in a design process). \  \ - On p4 (â€œPhase 2: rehearsal workshopsâ€ù) we have explained that in the rehearsal workshops we accommodated the possibility that the initial scenes could be radically changed and in some workshops we explored issues that were tangential to our collaborators but crucial for participants. \  \ - On p4 (â€œPhase 3: Performance developmentâ€ù) we have added an additional point explaining the performance was intended to convey realism of the situation with a degree of humour (as deemed acceptable by the participants in the rehearsal workshops) in order to deliver a captivating and engaging performance.  \   \ REFLECTIONS ON THE METHOD (p8-9): \ We have made substantial changes to the MAKING LIVE THEATRE WORK IN DESIGN section. This includes: \  \ - Adding a paragraph to point 3 (Live theatre promoted tackling complex interpersonal relations of future scenarios and revealed critical insights for the NetCarers service and system design) that discusses some of the design requirements and insights that emerged for NetCarers as it relates to digital technology. \  \ - Expanding point 5 (Theatricality can impede active participant engagement and trivialise participant expertise and knowledge.) extensively to include more critical reflections on the limitations of using live theatre in this way, particular as it can be a barrier to participant involvement or not be representative of existing practice due to its fictional framing.  \  \ - Adding a new point 6 (Live theatre can be resource intensive but has gains beyond design.) that talks about the resource intensity of the process but also the potential gains relating to project dissemination that come from using theatre in the way that we did. \  \ - Focusing the titles of some of the discussion points to be more reflective of the three issues introduced at the start of the paper (exploring future scenarios, prototyping experiences and understanding peopleâ€™s lived experiences in a design process). \  \ - Introducing more explicit examples of participants â€œvoicesâ€ù throughout the section, or explicitly relating our discussion points to issues referred to in the Findings section. \  \ - Removing the previous point 4 (Live theatre can be an accessible way for participants to contribute to design of complex services without drawing on traditional notions of design expertise) to make space. \  \ ADDITIONAL: \ - The final version has been copy-edited and the text has been tightened throughout to aid reading and avoid repetition.  \ ",cultures,John Vines,Tess Denman-Cleaver,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 18:43,pn119,A,Pay or Delay: The Role of Technology When Managing a Low Income,John,Vines,john.vines@newcastle.ac.uk,pn0119-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"John Vines, Paul Dunphy, Andrew Monk","john.vines@ncl.ac.uk, paul.dunphy@ncl.ac.uk, A.Monk@psych.york.ac.uk",21260,John,,Vines,john.vines@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,14149,Paul,,Dunphy,paul.dunphy@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,1206,Andrew,,Monk,A.Monk@psych.york.ac.uk,,University of York,York,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper reports on a qualitative study of 38 low-income individuals living in the North East of England.

We have also introduced some additional prior literature in HCI: \  \ - Ames et al. and Yardi and Bruckman as examples of HCI work exploring how technology values relate to socio-economic status. \  \ - LeDantec et al and Grimes Parker et al as examples of work dealing with social exclusion. \  \ THE STUDY (p2-4): \ - We have added additional information about the participants involved in the study on p2, specifically that 18 (47%) of the participants were female, with a mean age of 60 years of age (our youngest participant was 23, our oldest 83). 92% of the participants were white British in their ethnicity. We have also discussed some of the overlaps between the different categories of participants. \  \ - We have added extensive detail to our description of the grounded theory approach we used as outlined in the rebuttal on p4. \  \ FINDINGS (p4-7): \  \ - We have edited the discussion of the â€œLifestyles, routines and making adjustmentsâ€ù theme (p4) so as not to focus so much on P22 and make it clearer that the views represent those shared by many participants. We have made similar subtle adjustment to the text in the â€œManaging and negotiating prioritiesâ€ù theme on p5. \  \ CONFIDENCE THROUGH AWARENESS (p7-8): \ - This section has been reduced in length and made more succinct to avoid repetition as noted by the reviewers. \  \ DESIGN CHALLENGES & OPPORTUNITIES (p8-p9): \ - We have also amended this section so as to avoid some repetition, and also clarified some of the discussion points raised in relation to â€œHidingâ€ù (p9). This includes a reference to Mazurek et al.  \  \ CONCLUSION (p9-10): \ - We have discussed the relationship our findings have to the ongoing work of DiSalvo et al and Dourish in the domain of sustainability. We follow the points raised by reviewer 3 that the technical infrastructure and services defined by the banking industry are inscribed with values on what banking should and should not be and these break down in light of the values and practices of the participants in our study. We link this into our original concluding point about making tools that allow us to move away from the institutional structuring of what is right and wrong in how people manage their own money. \  \ ADDITIONAL: \ - The final version has been copy-edited and the text has been tightened throughout to aid reading and avoid repetition.  \ ",,John Vines,Paul Dunphy,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/20/14 21:07,pn121,A,The Effects of Embodied Persuasive Games on Player Attitudes Toward People Using Wheelchairs,Kathrin,Gerling,kathrin.gerling@usask.ca,pn0121-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Kathrin Gerling, Regan Mandryk, Max Birk, Matthew Miller, Rita Orji","kathrin.gerling@usask.ca, regan@cs.usask.ca, max.birk@usask.ca, matthew.miller@usask.ca, rita.orji@usask.ca",22264,Kathrin,,Gerling,kathrin.gerling@usask.ca,,University of Saskatchewan,Saskatoon,Saskatchewan,Canada,,,,,,3590,Regan,,Mandryk,regan@cs.usask.ca,Interaction Lab,University of Saskatchewan,Saskatoon,Saskatchewan,Canada,,,,,,28546,Max,,Birk,max.birk@usask.ca,,University of Saskatchewan,Saskatoon,Saskatchewan,Canada,,,,,,36953,Matthew,,Miller,matthew.miller@usask.ca,,University of Saskatchewan,Saskatoon,Saskatchewan,Canada,,,,,,28728,Rita,,Orji,rita.orji@usask.ca,,University of Saskatchewan,Saskatoon,Saskatchewan,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"People using wheelchairs face barriers in their daily lives, many of which are created by people who surround them. Promoting positive attitudes towards persons with disabilities is an integral step in removing these barriers and improving their quality of life. In this context, persuasive games offer an opportunity of encouraging attitude change. We created a wheelchair-controlled persuasive game to study how embodied interaction can be applied to influence player attitudes over time. Our results show that the game intervention successfully raised awareness for challenges that people using wheelchairs face, and that embodied interaction is a more effective approach than traditional input in terms of retaining attitude change over time. Based on these findings, we provide design strategies for embodied interaction in persuasive games, and outline how our findings can be leveraged to help designers create effective persuasive experiences beyond games.",Paper,Kathrin Gerling,kathrin.gerling@usask.ca,"1.

Such keyboards have been used extensively for touch devices, but not in mid-air, even though their fluent gestural input seems well suited for this modality. We present Vulture, a word-gesture keyboard for mid-air operation. Vulture adapts touch based word-gesture algorithms to work in mid-air, projects usersâ€™ movement onto the display, and uses pinch as a word delimiter. A first 10-session study suggests text-entry rates of 20.6 Words Per Minute (WPM) and finds hand-movement speed to be the primary predictor of WPM. A second study shows that with training on a few phrases, participants do 28.1 WPM, 59% of the text-entry rate of direct touch input. Participantsâ€™ recall of trained gestures in mid-air was low, suggesting that visual feedback is important but also limits performance. Based on data from the studies, we discuss improvements to Vulture and some alternative designs for mid-air text entry.",Paper,Anders Markussen,amark@diku.dk,"1.

Audience membersâ€™ experiences are not well understood, nor are the factors of videogaming sessions that influence their experience. We conducted a study to examine the effects of game physicality and turn anticipation on audience membersâ€™ experiences in social videogaming sessions. Pairs of participants played games under three conditions of physicality (controller-based, Wii, and Kinect) and their expectation of turn-taking was manipulated. Their enjoyment, game engagement, social engagement and sense of participation were measured. We found that the introduction of turn-taking into the session had positive effects for audience members â€“ both anticipated and residual play effects â€“ and that Kinect gameplay resulted in a more enjoyable experience for audience members. We argue that audience membersâ€™ experience changes as they become more active within a session, and suggest there are design opportunities between purely active â€˜playersâ€™ and passive â€˜audience membersâ€™.",Paper,John Downs,jdowns@student.unimelb.edu.au,"1.

Based on the devicesâ€™ spatial configurations, Duet coordinates their motion and touch input, and extends their visual and tactile output to one another. This transforms the watch into an active element that enhances a wide range of phone-based interactive tasks, and enables a new class of multi-device gestures and sensing techniques.

We have addressed the listed recommendations as best as possible given the limed space allowed by the note.  Please see the list below for a summary of the changes.  Please contact us if there are further questions or concerns. \  \ â€œMore technical detailsâ€ù: We expanded the final paragraph in the â€œModeling Camera Motionâ€ù section to give more details on the matching process between frames, computation of the camera transformations, and decomposition into motions parameters.  We expanded the second to last paragraph in â€œStylizing Camera Motion Interactivelyâ€ù to include more details on how the frequency components are computed and mapped to the sliders. \  \ â€œClaims of intuitivenessâ€ù: We made several small changes throughout the document to adjust the language.  Changes were mainly in the intro, results, and discussion.   \  \ â€œUsability limitations and shortcomings of having so many slidersâ€ù:  We added to â€œGeneral Study Observationsâ€ù section to indicate that our study is preliminary and there are many future studies to that would be worth running, such as examining the number of sliders. \  \ â€œDirect Manipulationâ€ù: We added the Dragicevic et al. reference and discuss direct manipulation in the discussion section. \ Figures: We follow second meta-reviewerâ€™s suggestions and removed the Figures 3 and 4 and used this extra space to make Figure 1 much larger and the caption more comprehensive.  We also increased the contrast and visibility of Figure 1.

Doing domestic sustainability interventions?  Find out about digital media and IT impacts, and how these connect to everyday practice. \ ","Submission 155: List of changes to submitted version \  \ Thanks for your insightful comments, using the meta review and our rebuttal as a starting point, we've extensively reworked the paper, including a substantial reorganisation to improve the flow of argument, more sensitively position the findings, and make the contributions sharper and easier to appreciate.  We summarise the key changes to the work below: \  \ 1.	We have clarified that we plan to include Cloud and CDN impacts as a future goal. This has been added to a new section entitled â€˜Limitations and Assumptionsâ€™. \ 2.	Examples of Indirect Impacts have been added to  `Indirect Impactsâ€™ subsection in `Configurations and Impactsâ€™. These examples are used to illustrate the potential impacts of indirect emissions. \ 3.	In the `Media and IT practices section we have added some examples of common ways of doing among our participants (e.g. â€œIan, Donna and Henry mentioned that group film and TV nights would happen occasionallyâ€ù, and â€œGary and Natasha had specific media devices for audio playback (CD Player, and record player respectivelyâ€_â€ù), as proposed in the rebuttal.   \ 4.	To avoid reliance on aggregate figures, Figure 2 has been replaced (see new Figure 1). Fig 1 now shows the embodied impact of our participantsâ€™ inventories and constellations. This figure shows the distribution of embodied carbon much more clearly across our participants.  \ 5.	Table 3 now has had 2 additional entries calculated and added (DVD/Blu-ray Player, and CD/Record player separate) as these were missing from the original table and are required in the new Fig 1. \ 6.	Captions of Figures 3 and 4 have been clarified, as mentioned in the rebuttal. \ 7.	The caption for Table 4 has been edited to better describe how the reductions in impacts have been calculated and who the reductions effect. \ 8.	The concept of â€˜Connoisseurshipâ€™ has been elaborated on: Extra examples of connoisseur-like practices and configurations are used to reinforce the concept of connoisseurs by showing that more than just two participants have connoisseur-like devices \ 9.	As mentioned in our rebuttal, we have clarified the subtleties of our implications, the importance of considering which devices deserve consideration rather than simply that devices generally need to have longer lifetimes.  \ 10.	We have further elaborated on implications for off-line storage of streamed media for disconnected consumption, communal resource sharing, power strategies that respect device constellations, as mentioned in our rebuttal. \ 11.	The `Methodsâ€™ section has been expanded to include a â€˜Limitations and Assumptionsâ€™ section that acknowledges the generalisability of our participant sample to other student populations \ 12.	In the â€˜Embodied Emissionsâ€™ subsection of â€˜Inventoriesâ€™ we have added a sentence explaining that the embodied estimates we use represent a lower-bound.  \ 13.	In â€˜Limitations and Assumptionsâ€™ we have explained why we have intentionally not factored in the lifetimes of devices, as this was unknown. \ 14.	To emphasise that our participantsâ€™ devices were not shared, we have added a paragraph in â€˜Methodsâ€™ describing where the media and IT devices were primarily used and kept.  \ 15.	The â€˜Methodsâ€™ were expanded to include a description of how we handled the qualitative analysis. \  \ Changes inspired by suggestions from reviewers: \ 1.	Related work has been reworked to better show how our work builds upon, or is different from previous works in HCI. \ 2.	The following references have been added to related work, as suggested by reviewers: Huang and Truong (CHI 2008), Wakkary et al (CHI 2009), and Kim and Paulos (CHI 2011) Woodruff et al (CHI 2008). \ 3.	The section titled â€˜An Holistic Viewâ€™ has been removed and its content folded into the â€˜Related Workâ€™ and â€˜Methodsâ€™ sections to improve the flow of the paper. \ 4.	We have clarified that our analysis does not include disposal or recycling impacts (Footnote 2) \ 5.	Relevant parts of the sections â€˜Constellationsâ€™ (originally p6) and â€˜Embodied Emissionsâ€™ have been merged with the â€˜Inventoriesâ€™ section to improve flow (they are now described before media and IT practices are presented). \ 6.

This will likely create a need for digital bulletin boards and for a better understanding of how such displays should be designed to encourage community members to interact with them. Our study addresses this by exploring community bulletin boards as a ubiquitous type of participatory non-digital display â€œin the wildâ€ù. Our results highlight how they are used for content of local and contextual relevance, and how cultures of participation, personalization, location, the tangible character of architecture, access, control and flexibility might affect community membersâ€™ level of engagement with them. Our analysis suggests entry points as design considerations intrinsically linked to the usersâ€™ sense of agency within a delineated space.

Validates and synthetizes previous research and suggests new entry points for cultures of participation. ,"First, we thoroughly combed through the following studies to identify and cite every exact point of overlap with findings from our study : Alt et al. (2011), Churchill et al. (2003), Huang et al. (2008) and Taylor et Cheverst (2008); as well as Brignull et al. (2004), McCarthy et al. (2009), and Grasso et al. (1999 and 2000). Second, we extended some of these findings by fleshing them out with new or more granular observations with regards to categories of postings or to board characteristics, but more importantly, we contribute to this area of research by placing greater emphasis on developing novel findings in the section titled: â€œEntry Points for Action and Participationâ€ù. Third, we rewrote the abstract, the last part of the Introduction and the last part of the Related Work section to make it clear that our contribution is twofold: validation of findings in related work and novel findings that hone in on the users, on entry points, on a deeper analysis of postings, etc. Four, we clarified ambiguities in our Methodology section. Five, the design considerations in the Discussion section are now proposed as suggestions that are more abstract and conceptual to be more consistent with the notion of entry points. Six, the Conclusion now has two new paragraphs: the first summarizes which findings our study validates from previous work, while the second presents the novel findings and new considerations we propose. The six figures (images) had to be taken out to fit the paper on ten pages. Given that we have plenty of photos, we will include these in our presentation to illustrate novel findings, especially around specific examples of entry points for participation.",,Claude Fortin,Carman Neustaedter,,ContentComplete,,9/9/14 16:28,pn169,A,Shared Values/Conflicting Logics: Working Around E-Government Systems,Amy,Voida,amyvoida@iupui.edu,pn0169-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Amy Voida, Lynn Dombrowski, Gillian Hayes, Melissa Mazmanian","amyvoida@iupui.edu, ldombrow@uci.edu, gillianrh@ics.uci.edu, mmazmani@uci.edu",2135,Amy,,Voida,amyvoida@iupui.edu,School of Informatics and Computing,"Indiana University, IUPUI",Indianapolis,Indiana,United States,,,,,,12675,Lynn,,Dombrowski,ldombrow@uci.edu,,"University of California, Irvine",Irvine,California,United States,,,,,,2555,Gillian,,Hayes,gillianrh@ics.uci.edu,,"University of California, Irvine",Irvine,California,United States,,,,,,16412,Melissa,,Mazmanian,mmazmani@uci.edu,,"University of California, Irvine",Irvine,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper, we describe results from fieldwork conducted at a social services site where the workers evaluate citizensâ€™ applications for food and medical assistance submitted via an e-government system. These results suggest value tensions that resultâ€”not from different stakeholders with different valuesâ€”but from differences among how stakeholders enact the same shared value in practice. In the remainder of this paper, we unpack the distinct and conflicting interpretations or logics of three shared valuesâ€”efficiency, access, and education. In particular, we analyze what happens when social services workers have ideas about what it means to expand access, increase efficiency, and educate the public that conflict with the logics embedded in the e-government system. By distinguishing between overarching values and specific logics, we provide an analytic framework for exploring value tensions as values are enacted in practice.",Paper,Amy Voida,amyvoida@iupui.edu,"1.

In particular, Reviewer 1 thinks the â€œprovided task was too simple and it is difficult to generalize the results based on this simple task. I would expect a bit more dynamic task in order to see how the results with some more dynamicity replicate the original study conducted by Bonnie John.â€ù The authors may also want to elaborate on how and why the tasks are decided. \  \ Summary of changes: \  \ 1. The Introduction was edited to remove mention a third contribution that reviewers considered weak: a preliminary account of how CogTool improves novice modeler design recommendations. This point was recast in the Design Recommendations with Cogtool section as being suggestive for further research. \  \ 2. A new paragraph was added to the Method section to explain our choice of task. We draw a parallel to John's paper and explain that changing the task would have introduced a new factor that could have complicated interpretation of results if the replication had failed. We mention that generalization to more complex tasks remains for future work. \ ",,Kyung Wha Hong,Robert St. Amant,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/3/14 21:52,pn180,A,Didn't You See My Message?

Hence, existing instant messaging services for mobile phones share indicators of availability, such as the last time the user has been online. However, in this paper we not only provide evidence that these cues create social pressure, but that they are also weak predictors of attentiveness. As remedy, we propose to share a machine-computed prediction of whether the user will view a message within the next few minutes or not. For two weeks, we collected behavioral data from 24 users of mobile instant messaging services. By the means of machine-learning techniques, we identified that simple features extracted from the phone, such as the userâ€™s interaction with the notification center, the screen activity, the proximity sensor, and the ringer mode, are strong predictors of how quickly the user will attend to the messages. With seven automatically selected features our model predicts whether a phone user will view a message within a few minutes with 70.6% accuracy and a precision for fast attendance of 81.2%",Paper,Martin Pielot,martin.pielot@gmail.com,"1.

In the second, we observe naturalistic use of CommandMaps over the course of a week, and gather qualitative data from interviews, questionnaires, and conversations.

We approach our inquiry with mixed methods: (1) quantitative study to test whether epistemic cognition might differ in individual and social contexts, and whether online interactions might mediate the later; and (2) social cognitive task analysis with interviews to manifest the intricate interplay of dynamics between social epistemic cognition and online interactions.

However, a lack of efficacy as well as problems with habituation in such systems are well known issues. In this paper, we propose to leverage the rich set of personal data available on smartphones to communicate risks using personalized examples. Examples of private information that may be at risk can draw the users' attention to relevant information for a decision and also improve their response. We present two experiments that validate this approach in the context of Android app permissions. Private information that becomes accessible given certain permissions is displayed when a user wants to install an app, demonstrating the consequences this installation might have. We find that participants made more privacy-conscious choices when deciding which apps to install. Additionally, our results show that our approach causes a negative affect in participants, which makes them pay more attention.",Paper,Marian Harbach,harbach@dcsec.uni-hannover.de,"1. Au, K. W.

Prior work has demonstrated a variety of modifications to existing interfaces, including accessibility enhancements, interface language translation, testing frameworks, and interaction techniques. But pixel-based methods have also been limited in their understanding of the interface and therefore the complexity of modifications they can support. This work examines deeper pixel-level understanding of widgets and the resulting capabilities of pixel-based runtime enhancements. Specifically, we present three new sets of methods: methods for pixel-based modeling of widgets in multiple states, methods for managing the combinatorial complexity that arises in creating a multitude of runtime enhancements, and methods for styling runtime enhancements to preserve consistency with the design of an existing interface. We validate our methods through an implementation of Moscovich et al.â€™s Sliding Widgets, a novel runtime enhancement that could not have been implemented with prior pixel-based methods.",Paper,Gierad Laput,gierad.laput@cs.cmu.edu,"1.

Distributed user interfaces have received increasing attention over the past years. There are different, often model-based, approaches that focus on technical issues. This paper presents XDStudio--a new GUI builder designed to support interactive development of cross-device web interfaces. XDStudio implements two complementary authoring modes with a focus on the design process of distributed user interfaces. First, simulated authoring allows designing for a multi-device environment on a single device by simulating other target devices. Second, on-device authoring allows the design process itself to be distributed over multiple devices, as design and development take place on the target devices themselves. To support interactive development for multi-device environments, where not all devices may be present at design and run-time, XDStudio supports switching between the two authoring modes, as well as between design and use modes, as required. This paper focuses on the design of XDStudio, and evaluates its support for two distribution scenarios.",Paper,Michael Nebeling,nebeling@inf.ethz.ch,"1.

The results for 15/5 are within 1% difference with those for 17/3. \  \ - Participants Information \ We report the age, gender, height, BMI distribution of our participants.  \  \ - Per-participant training \ We clarify the limitation with our current system: we require training for participants independently and point out the solution we proposed to try out but were told by the shepherd not to -- use a 3D-printed chin support. \  \ - Robustness test \ We repeated the robustness test with a full set of 6 gestures for a 4 hours session. The accuracies changed little with time, similar to our previous results for three gestures (left, right, rest). \  \ - False Positive test \ We repeat the false positive test with four participants for six gestures for 90 minutes each. The false positive probability remains low as previously reported. \  \ - Passphrase system section removed \  \ - Contributions and Concurrent Work \ We point out concurrent work by Sasaki et al. and contrast their work with ours, highlighting the fact that our system is a significant step towards making Tongue Machine Interface a practical system.",,Qiao Zhang,Shyamnath Gollakota,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/19/14 5:29,pn216,A,The Impact of Visual Contextualization on UI Localization,Luis A.,Leiva,luileito@upv.es,pn0216-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Luis A.

Besides the jargon and technical terms, many of the strings are often very short, such as those shown in buttons and pull-down menus. Then, as a result of the lack of visual context in the traditional localization process, an important ambiguity problem arises. We study three approaches to solve this problem: using plain gettext (baseline condition), using gettext plus being able to operate the UI, and translating the UI in-place. We found that translators are substantially faster with plain gettext but commit a significantly higher number of errors in comparison to the other approaches. Unexpectedly, the mixed condition was slower and more error-prone than in-place translation. The latter was found to be comparable to plain gettext in terms of time, although some strings passed unnoticed as the UI was operated. Based on our results, we arrive at a set of recommendations to augment localization tools to improve translator's productivity.",Note,Luis A. Leiva,llt@acm.org,"1. Dunne, K. J., Ed.

This paper explores how and why people take breaks from social media. Using a mixed methods approach, we pair data from users who tweeted about giving up Twitter for Lent with an interview study of social media users. We find that 64% of users who proclaim that they are giving up Twitter for Lent successfully do so. Among those who fail, 31% acknowledge their failure; the other 69% simply return. We observe hedging patterns (e.g. â€œI thought about giving up Twitter for Lent butâ€_â€ù) that surfaced uncertainty about social media behavior. Interview participants were concerned about the tradeoffs of spending time on social media versus doing other things and of spending time on social media rather than in â€œreal life.â€ù We discuss gaps in related theory that might help reduce usersâ€™ anxieties and open design problems related to designing systems and services that can help users manage their own social media use.

We explore Hand-to-Face interaction to find suitable techniques for common mobile tasks.  We evaluate this form of interaction with document navigation tasks and examine its social acceptability. In a first study, users identify the cheek and forehead as predominant areas for interaction and agree on gestures for tasks involving continuous input, such as document navigation. These results guide the design of several Hand-to-Face navigation techniques and reveal that gestures performed on the cheek are more efficient and less tiring than interactions directly on the HWD. Initial results on the social acceptability of Hand-to-Face input allow us to further refine our design choices, and reveal unforeseen results: some gestures are considered culturally inappropriate and gender plays a role in selection of specific Hand-to-Face interactions. From our overall results, we provide a set of guidelines for developing effective Hand-to-Face interaction techniques.

Please advise if there are any other changes that need to be included. \  \ 1)	Be clear about limitations of findings based on the prototype \  \ *** We further added this limitation in the Guessability study section (page #4) as well as in the Limitations section of the paper.  \  \  \ 2) For the study participants itâ€™d be good to clarify where the students were from - presumably the university. \  \ *** We made it more specific that our participants were from a local university.  \  \  \ 3) Previous knowledge of guessability study participants \  \ *** We addressed this in the section on Participants in the guessability study. We also added in our limitations that a broader population would result in making stronger claims for the guessability and social acceptability.  \  \  \ 4) Questions on social acceptance study \  \ *** We clarified that only one question was asked. We added the following texts to address R5s concerns: \  \ ""For every gesture and social context we asked the same question: â€œWould you be willing to perform this gesture in context X?â€ù "" \  \ ""This type of exploration based on video watching has already been used in previous studies [2]. Although it misses the ecological validity of an experiment in a real environment, it allows for a first exploration of a novel technique. "" \  \ ""While our social acceptability study is a laboratory exploration that should be expanded to the real environment, it indicates that hand-to-face interaction could be acceptable in different social contexts.""  \  \  \ 5) Discussion on the limitations of the social acceptability study \  \ *** We have added a deeper discussion in the limitation and also tone down our claims of our social acceptability study in various parts of the document. The text we have added to the various segments of the paper is: \  \ ""Our social acceptability study was based on video browsing gestures. Future work should test the acceptability of such interactions in real settings, such as in [22]. Factors such as gender and cultural ethnicity also need to be considered for improved Hand-to-Face input. For instance we can compare usersâ€™ perceived acceptability between Asian and Western populations as in [22]."" \  \  \ ""This type of exploration based on video watching has already been used in previous studies [2]. Although it misses the ecological validity of an experiment in a real environment, it allows for a first exploration of a novel technique. "" \  \  \ ""... We therefore carry a controlled exploration of the social acceptance of our hand-to-face gestures."" \  \ We thank the ACs for directing the necessary changes in the paper. \  \ ============== \  \ Second set of revisions \  \ Thank you for your feedback and help on improving our paper.

We made the following changes (highlighted now in green in the paper):  \  \ 1) I disagree with the statement:  ""research students with a large cultural background""  \  \ ** we removed the sentence claiming the Ã«broadÃ_ ethnic background of participants.  \  \  \ 2) Thanks for the many additions to the social acceptability study.  \ I would still modify the following:  \ ""...it indicates that hand-to-face interaction is acceptable in different social contexts."" \ to  \ ""it indicates that hand-to-face interaction could be acceptable in different social contexts."" \  \ ** We changed this sentence as suggested. \  \ 3) References: \ Please include ALL authors for ALL references. (regardless of number of authors on the paper) \  \ ** We apologize for overlooking this. We have formatted the references and included all names of authors.  \  \ 4) Discussion on mid-air gestures is missing (R4) \  \ ** We added the following sentence when discussing acceptability issues: Ã¬However, mid-air gestures need to be carefully designed to include proper delimiters, to not appear socially unacceptable, and to be evaluated against on-face input as a touch-less solution for addressing the issue of facial cosmetics.Ã® \  \ ** We welcome other additions/recommendations to this revision. \  \ 5) Participant background \ Many details are still missing as pointed out by R4, R5, R7. \  \ ** We added the details we have for the participantsÃ_ background in Experiments 1, 2 and in the Social acceptability study. We also added that they were rewarded with a gift card. We do not have some of the details requested such as income levels. \  \ Please take a much closer look at R5 and R7's comments as they will also be looking at this paper before it can be accepted.  \  \ ** We realized that we missed adding the detail about the counterbalancing in experiment 2. We have added that and hope to have addressed R7Ã_s concerns.  \  \ The most important part right now is to be honest and upfront about the limitations of this work and provide all the details to avoid the impression that some reviewers had that the paper is overclaiming.  \  \ ** We hope the revisions we made tones down our claims to capture specifically what our results say and not to overclaim. In making sure our revisions could fit the page limit, we also reduced the size of the social acceptability study section. \  \  \ Please advise us of any necessary changes that need to get addressed to satisfy the reviewers requests. \ Thank you. \  \  \ ============== \  \ First set of revisions \  \ Thank you for your help in improving our paper with the changes suggested by reviewers. Please find below a list of the main changes based on the reviews, on the changes promised in the rebuttal and on the comments from the secondary ACs. We highlighted the main changes in the document for your convenience. On your approval of this document, we will submit a final revision with the highlights removed.  \  \ List of changes on the final version: \  \ 1.	Guessability study participants:  \  \ We detailed the background of participants (page 3) :  \ - â€œHand-To-Face interaction being novel, we did not pre-select our participants according to their level of expertise: all users were naÃ¯ve concerning this specific type of interaction. Most of our participants were research students with a large cultural backgroundâ€ù \  \ 2.	Gesture agreement score:  \ We discussed the low score (page 5). \  \ 3.	Taxonomy:  \ We discussed the number of properties.  \ â€œWhile this taxonomy could include many properties, such as the number of hands, we describe only the properties sufficient to characterize our results.â€ù \ We cited the percentages for each property (page 5). \  \  \ 4.	Tracking accuracy and latency:  \ We included details on tracking coverage, accuracy and latency (page 6). \ - â€œDuring our studies we had a negligible number of tracking errors (0.15% of all trials). The system had no perceivable latency: all input was merged to the same program and sent to the HWD through USB. Optical tracking ran at 690 Hz; contact sensor at 600 Hz; merged data were sent to the HWD at a measured rate of 142 Hz.  â€œ  (page 6) \  \  \ 5.	Experiments details:  \ We detailed the conditions of the experiments, flick parameters and average training time. \  \ - â€œ Participants wore the mock HWD for both conditions.â€ù (page 3) \ - â€œThe complete gesture set is available onlineâ€ù (page 4) \ - â€œWe implemented face gestures using a Vicon T20 infrared optical tracking system with six cameras positioned around the user (front, front-right and right side at different heights).â€ù (page 6) \  \ 6.	Social acceptability study:  \ We lowered the claims on this study in the abstract, in the study section and in the discussion on limitations. \ - â€œWhile our social acceptability study is a laboratory exploration that should be expanded to the real environment, it indicates that hand-to-face interaction is acceptable in different social contexts.â€ù (page 9) \  \ - â€œResearch students composed the most of our studies participants. The findings of our work should be verified with a larger sample of population, particularly concerning social acceptability issues. Our social acceptability study was based on video browsing gestures. In future we plan to test the acceptability of these interactions in real settings.â€ù (page 10) \  \ 7. Gestures alternatives:  \ We discussed the gesture set produced by our study in the discussion section. We added the sub-section â€œGesture alternativesâ€ù in the Discussion: \ â€œGesture alternatives \ Prior work on user-generated gestures, indicated that designers came up with only 60% of the gestures produced by end-users [40]. This gives some evidence that users may, in some instances, generate a larger set of alternatives than a few designers. Some gestures may have been missed though, such as using pressure for zooming. Our final gestures resemble known multi-touch gestures as we had to select a set that was compatible with our baseline, the HWD temple: given its limited surface area, our choice of gestures was limited. In future, we intend on exploring other interactions without the baseline restrictions. â€œ \  \ 7.	References:  \ We added the missing references: \ 17.

But browsing such videos is often tedious and \ inefficient because video player interfaces are not optimized for the \ unique step-by-step structure of such videos. This research aims to \ improve the learning experience of existing how-to videos  \ with step-by-step annotations. \  \ We first performed a formative study to verify that annotations are \ actually useful to learners. \ We created ToolScape, an interactive \ video player that displays step descriptions  \ and intermediate result thumbnails in the video timeline. Learners in \ our study performed better and gained more self-efficacy using ToolScape \ versus a traditional video player. \  \ To add the needed step annotations to existing how-to videos at scale, we introduce a novel crowdsourcing workflow. It extracts step-by-step structure from an existing video, including step times, descriptions, and before and after images. \ We introduce the Find-Verify-Expand design pattern for temporal and visual annotation, which applies clustering, text processing, and visual analysis algorithms to merge crowd output. The workflow does not rely on domain-specific customization, works on top of existing videos, and recruits untrained crowd workers. We evaluated the workflow with Mechanical Turk, using 75 cooking, makeup, and Photoshop videos on YouTube. Results show that our workflow can extract steps with a quality comparable to that of trained annotators across all three domains with 77% precision and 81% recall.

While previous systems have introduced sketch-based animations for individual objects, our contribution is a unified framework of motion controls that allows users to seamlessly add coordinated motions to object collections. We propose a framework built around kinetic textures, which provide continuous animation effects while preserving the unique timeless nature of still illustrations. This enables many dynamic effects difficult or not possible with previous sketch-based tools, such as a school of fish swimming, tree leaves blowing in the wind, or water rippling in a pond. We describe our implementation and illustrate the repertoire of animation effects it supports. A user study with professional animators and casual users demonstrates the variety of animations, applications and creative possibilities our tool provides.",Paper,Rubaiat Habib Kazi,rubaiat.habib@gmail.com,"1.

However, these modalities have never been combined exhaustively and tested under conditions of varying situational urgency to assess their effectiveness both in the presence and absence of critical driving events. This paper describes an experiment evaluating all multimodal combinations of such warnings under two contexts of situational urgency: a lead car braking and not braking. The results showed that participants responded quicker to more urgent warnings, especially in the presence of a car braking. They also responded faster to the multimodal as opposed to unimodal signals. Driving behaviour improved in the presence of the warnings and the absence of a car braking.

We show how this can be used to determine when to pay attention to a userâ€™s actions and when to ignore them. To demonstrate the value of our approach, we present results from a 30-person lab study conducted to compare four engagement algorithms in single and multi-user scenarios.

To resolve this problem, we present CAUSALITY, a conceptual model of interaction history that clarifies the possibilities for temporal interactions. The model includes components for the work artifact (such as the text and formatting of a Word document), the system context (such as the settings and parameters of the user interface), the linear timeline (the commands executed in real time), and the branching chronology (a structure of executed commands and their impact on the artifact and/or context, which may be navigable by the user). We then describe and exemplify how this model can be used to encapsulate existing user interfaces and reveal limitations in their behaviour, and we also show in a conceptual evaluation how the model stimulates the design of new and innovative opportunities for interacting in time.",Paper,Mathieu Nancel,mathieu@nancel.net,"1.

Then, we identify two properties that this game shares with many other games on tangible platforms and discuss how these properties influence both the game design process and the player experience.

While research has reported benefits associated with components of SNS usage, a digital divide has emerged between younger and older users. SNSs can be useful for communicating with family members and helping one feel digitally included; however, there is a wide range of reasons why many older adults choose not to use this kind of technology. We present a series of user studies investigating the barriers and challenges that SNSs can present to older users. These user studies led to the derivation of user recommendations to mitigate these barriers. The recommendations were then evaluated within a comparative evaluation which involved 25 older adults completing tasks on two interface versions of a simulation SNS.

We introduce Twitch, a mobile phone application that asks users to make a micro-contribution each time they unlock their phone. Twitch takes advantage of the common habit of turning to the mobile phone in spare moments. Twitch crowdsourcing activities span goals such as authoring a census of local human activity, rating stock photos, and extracting structured data from Wikipedia pages. We report a field deployment of Twitch where 82 users made 11,240 crowdsourcing contributions as they used their phone in the course of everyday life. The median Twitch activity took just 1.6 seconds, incurring no statistically distinguishable costs to unlock speed or cognitive load compared to a standard slide-to-unlock interface.

We hypothesize that by codifying emergent programming behavior, software engineering interfaces can support a far broader set of developer needs. To explore this idea, we built Codex, a knowledge base that records common practice for the Ruby programming language by indexing over three million lines of popular code. Codex enables new data-driven interfaces for programming systems: statistical linting, identifying code that is unlikely to occur in practice and may constitute a bug; pattern annotation, automatically discovering common programming idioms and annotating them with metadata using expert crowdsourcing; and library generation, constructing a utility package that encapsulates and reflects emergent software practice. We evaluate these applications to find Codex captures a broad swatch of programming practice, statistical linting detects problematic code snippets, and pattern annotation discovers nontrivial idioms such as basic HTTP authentication and database migration templates. Our work suggests that operationalizing practice-driven knowledge in structured domains such as programming can enable a new class of user interfaces. ",Paper,Ethan Fast,ethaen@stanford.edu,"1.

Further, arbitrary objects can seem to emit sound. We use spatial sound reproduction for sound rendering and computer vision for tracking. Using our approach, sounds can be heard from anywhere in the room and always appear to originate from the same (possibly moving) position, regardless of the listener's position. We demonstrate that direct ""touch"" interaction with sound is an interesting alternative to indirect interaction mediated through controllers or visual interfaces. We show that sound localization is surprisingly accurate (11.5 cm), even in the presence of distractors. We propose to leverage the ventriloquist effect to further increase localization accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how affordances of real objects can create synergies of auditory and visual feedback. As an application of the system, we built a spatial music mixing room.",Paper,Joerg Mueller,joerg.mueller@tu-berlin.de,"1. Berkhout, A. A holographic approach to acoustic control.

People passing by see their own contour mirrored on a public display and can start to play with virtual objects. At the same time, they see others playing at remote displays within the same virtual space. We are interested whether people would use such a public display media space, and if so, how and why. We evaluate Communiplay in a field study in six connected locations and find a remote honey-pot effect, i.e. people interacting at one location attract people at other locations. The conversion rate (percentage of passers-by starting to interact) rose by +136% when people saw others playing at remote locations. We also provide the first quantification of the (local) honey-pot effect (in our case it raised the conversion rate by +604% when people saw others playing at the same location). We conclude that the integration of multiple public displays into a media space is a promising direction for public displays and can make them more attractive and valuable.",Paper,Joerg Mueller,joerg.mueller@tu-berlin.de,"1.

The system comprises two mobile applications: one victim application that allows the broadcasting of distress signals by a novel use of Wi-Fi SSIDs; and a responder application that allows first responders to discover and trace the people broadcasting the signals. The main difference of our system with other platforms enabling communication in crisis situations is that our system is independent from existing network infrastructure and runs on off-the-shelf, commercially available smartphones.

However, it has barely been investigated so far how the user interface (UI) can cope with the challenges of the vision-based localization technique, such as varying quality of the query images. We implemented a novel UI for visual localization, consisting of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) views that actively communicate and ensure localization accuracy. If necessary, the system encourages the user to point the smartphone at distinctive regions to improve localization quality. We evaluated the UI in a experimental navigation task with a prototype, informed by initial evaluation results using design mockups. We found that VR can contribute to efficient and effective indoor navigation even at unreliable location and orientation accuracy.

It is often claimed that research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) contains too few replications. To investigate this claim we examined four publication outlets (891 papers) and found 3% attempting replication of an earlier result. The replications typically confirmed earlier findings, but treated replication as a confirm/not-confirm decision, rarely analyzing effect sizes or comparing in depth to the replicated paper. When asked, most authors agreed that their studies were replications, but rarely planned them as such. Many non-replication studies could have corroborated earlier work if they had analyzed data differently or used minimal effort to collect extra data. We discuss what these results mean to HCI, including how reporting of studies could be improved and how conferences/journals may change author instructions to get more replications.

The key idea is to save 3D printing time by automatically substituting sub-volumes with standard building blocksâ€”in our case Lego bricks. When making the body for a head-mounted display, for example, getting the optical path right is paramount. Users thus mark the lens mounts as â€œhigh-resolutionâ€ù to indicate that these should later be 3D printed. faBrickator then 3D prints these parts. It also generates instructions that show users how to create everything else from Lego bricks. If users iterate on the design later, faBrickator offers even greater benefit as it allows re-printing only the elements that changed. We validated our system at the example of three 3D models of functional objects. On average, our system fabricates objects 2.44 times faster than traditional 3D printing while requiring only 14 minutes of manual assembly.

However no tools exist for guiding designers in building those modular devices and especially for choosing the shape of the units. The task becomes even more complex when the units themselves can change their shapes to animate the entire assembly. In this paper, we contribute with the first analysis tool which helps the designer to both choose the right subset of forms for the units and to create an assembly with maximum accuracy from the set of given objects. We introduce the concept of Changibles that are interactive wireless units that can reshape themselves and be attached together to create an animated assembly.

The section is now called use case. \ - Discussion: the end emphasizes more about the fact that out tool provides the analyzing step in a design process and that it could be completed with additional framework for the other steps (design, build, evaluate). \ - also added the performance of the algorithm given in the rebuttal \  \ - I did not add any reference as the paper is quite dense. Especially reviewers suggest Poupyrev and Gomes but these references are quite oriented interaction technique rather than software. I could find ways to add them (as references on the first sentences of the introdution) but the paper will be really tight! Let me know what you think. \  \ ************** second round: \ **************  \ 1) I let figure 1c to keep the ratio of the figure and make more room in the rest of the paper \ 2) in introduction, I replaced the sentence: \ ""To tackle this problem we created a software analysis tool that allows one to import a set of objects and provides a set of a tractable subset of forms.

Based on the reviews, our rebuttal as well as on the final feedback from the AC we have made the following specific changes to our paper (our changes are indicated with '>>'): \  \ *** CATEGORIZATION OF THE SMELL STORIES (R2, R3)  \  \ >> We have rephrased the first paragraph in the â€˜finding sectionâ€™ on page 4 highlighting the categorization of the smell stories in the primary categories, but the fact that it does not define a strict line.  \  \ >> We have updated the description of category 1 and 2 in order to make the distinction (as described in the rebuttal) clear. See changes on page 4 and 5. \  \ >> We have carefully read through all categories again and made the descriptions clearer. Based on R2 comments we took also special care editing the category 3 and 4 descriptions as well as took the remarks on category 4 and 6 into account, which become also clearer due to the additions in category 1 and 2.  \  \ *** REFERENCE SUGGESTIONS (R1)  \  \ >> We have added the paper by Bartosz et al. on page 8, in the discussion section (see new reference 35: Wyszynski, B., Yamanaka, T., Nakamoto, T. Recording and reproducing citrus flavors using odor recorder. Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical 106, 1 (2005), 388â€“393.) \  \ >> We have added the paper by Emsenhuber et al. on page 2, in the section smell and HCI (see new reference 9: Emsenhuber, B. Scent Marketing: Making Olfactory Advertising Pervasive. In J. MÃ_ller, F. Alt and D. Michelis (Eds.), Pervasive Advertising. Springer, (2011), 343â€“360.) \  \ *** MINOR ISSUES (R2, R3, R4, AC)  \  \ * Provide a clearer definition of experience and memory as raised by R2 and the AC in the related work, highlighting the link between experiences and memories through stories as data collection method used in this work.  \ >> We have rephrased the link between experience and memory on page 2 in section â€˜the potential of studying smell experiencesâ€™ \  \ * Provide significance measures for the quantitative data on p6 as suggested by R4. To compare the length of the stories we use a Mann-Whitney U test and will add this in the final version of the paper.   \ >> We have added significance measures for the quantitative comparison on page 6. \  \ Clarifications:  \ * R2 wonders about the gap between what participants and designers envisaged as future design ideas. Participants only had their own story as a starting point, while designers had a whole selection of stories available, which presumably stimulates different directions for design.   \ >> We have added a sentence at the beginning of the â€œImplications for technologyâ€ù section to highlight this point. \  \ * R2 pointed to the fact that the anonymous.com website is not available.    \ >> We have added the link to the website (multisensory.info). The website is not public yet, but you can access it here: http://www.multisensory.info/wordpress/ and will find a dedicated section on ""Smell"", where all details will be made available before the conference end of April.  \  \ * R3 is concerned about the sorting of the stories into negative and positive experiences. This sorting was done based on the participantsâ€™ own rating of their story (see p3, par.2 in part 1) and is not based on our opinion.  \ >> On page 3, in the description of Part 1, this issue is addressed, stating that participants were asked to indicate if their experience is positive, negative, or ambivalent (i.e., equally positive and negative). We have also added an additional sentence on page 4 (first paragraph of the finding section) to make this issue clear and avoid any confusion. \  ",,Marianna Obrist,Alexandre Tuch,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 14:24,pn330,A,History Assisted View Authoring for 3D Models,Hsiang-Ting,Chen,ht.timchen@gmail.com,pn0330-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Hsiang-Ting Chen, Tovi Grossman, Li-Yi Wei, Ryan Schmidt, BjÃ¶rn Hartmann, George Fitzmaurice, Maneesh Agrawala","ht.timchen@gmail.com, tovi.grossman@autodesk.com, liyiwei@stanfordalumni.org, rms@dgp.toronto.edu, bjoern@eecs.berkeley.edu, George.Fitzmaurice@autodesk.com, maneesh@cs.berkeley.edu",27038,Hsiang-Ting,,Chen,ht.timchen@gmail.com,University of Tokyo,Department of Computer Science,Tokyo,,Japan,,JST ERATO Igarashi Design Interface Project,Tokyo,,Japan,1476,Tovi,,Grossman,tovi.grossman@autodesk.com,,Autodesk Research,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,22042,Li-Yi,,Wei,liyiwei@stanfordalumni.org,,The University of Hong Kong,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,,,,,,5730,Ryan,,Schmidt,rms@dgp.toronto.edu,,Autodesk Research,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,5798,BjÃ¶rn,,Hartmann,bjoern@eecs.berkeley.edu,,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,California,United States,,,,,,1229,George,,Fitzmaurice,George.Fitzmaurice@autodesk.com,,Autodesk Research,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,3349,Maneesh,,Agrawala,maneesh@cs.berkeley.edu,,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3D modelers often wish to showcase their models for sharing or review purposes. This may consist of generating static viewpoints of the model or authoring animated fly-throughs. Manually creating such views is often tedious and few automatic methods are designed to interactively assist the modelers with the view authoring process. We present a view authoring assistance system that supports the creation of informative view points, view paths, and view surfaces, allowing modelers to author the interactive navigation experience of a model. The key concept of our implementation is to analyze the modelâ€™s workflow history, to infer important regions of the model and representative viewpoints of those areas. An evaluation indicated that the viewpoints generated by our algorithm are comparable to those manually selected by the modeler. In addition, participants of a user study found our system easy to use and effective for authoring viewpoint summaries.",Paper,Hsiang-Ting Chen,ht.timchen@gmail.com,"1. N. Burtnyk, A. Khan, G.

These manipulations can produce a range of different 2D visualizations that emphasize specific aspects of the dynamic network suited to particular analysis tasks.

In this way, we can leverage user familiarity and fluency with such tools to build a rich set of gestures for touch interaction.

Sixteen years after Whittaker and Sidner, we replicate and extend their work with a qualitative analysis of Googleâ€™s Gmail. We find that email overload, both in terms of volume and of status, is still a problem today. Our contributions are 1) updating the state of email overload, 2) extending our understanding of overload in the context of Gmail and 3) comparing personal with work email accounts: while work email tends to be status overloaded, personal email is also type overloaded.

Recent lab studies showed that file browser interface augmentations, such as Icon Highlights and Search Directed Navigation, have the potential to reduce file retrieval times. However, for this potential to be realised in actual systems, further study is necessary to address two important issues. First, there are important design and implementation challenges in advancing the research prototypes previously evaluated into complete interactive systems that can be used for real work. Second, it is unknown how real users would employ these systems while engaged in actual work; would the potential performance improvements suggested by the earlier lab studies be realised? We therefore describe the design, implementation, and longitudinal field study evaluation of Finder Highlights, a file browser plugin for the OS X 'Finder' that adds support for Icon Highlights and Search Directed Navigation. Study results confirm that the augmentations are effective in reducing real-world file retrieval times, with retrieval times 13% faster when using Finder Highlights compared to the standard tool (10.6 s versus 12.2 s), while also emphasising important differences between lab and field studies. In summary, the paper strongly suggests that large-scale deployment of interface augmentations to file browsers, particularly Icon Highlights, will have a marked effect in improving users' real-world file retrieval.",Paper,Stephen Fitchett,stephen.fitchett@pg.canterbury.ac.nz,"1.

It can also appear while observing another user making a mistake. This paper investigates ERN in collaborative settings where observing another user (the executer) perform a task is typical and then explores its applicability to HCI. We first show that ERN can be detected on signals captured by commodity EEG headsets like an Emotiv headset when observing another person perform a typical multiple-choice reaction time task. We then investigate the anticipation effects by detecting ERN in the time interval when an executer is reaching towards an answer. We show that we can detect this signal with both a clinical EEG device and with an Emotiv headset. Our results show that online single trial detection is possible using both headsets during tasks that are typical of collaborative interactive applications. However there is a trade-off between the detection speed and the quality/prices of the headsets. Based on the results, we discuss and present several HCI scenarios for use of ERN in observing tasks and collaborative settings.",Paper,Chi Thanh Vi,chi.vi@bristol.ac.uk,"1. Bates, A. T., Patel, T.

The little data we have on user experience is from single prototypes, only covering a small part of the possibilities in shape change. We produce 51 videos of a shape-changing handheld device by systematically varying seven parameters of shape change. In a crowd-sourced study, 187 participants watched the videos and described their experiences using rating scales and free text. We find significant and large differences among parameters of shape change. Shapes that have previously been used for notifications were rated the least urgent; the degree of shape change was found to impact experience more than type of shape change. The experience of shape change was surprisingly complex: hedonic quality were inversely related to urgency, and some shapes were perceived as ugly, yet useful. We discuss how to advance models of shape change and improve research on the experience of shape change.",Paper,Esben W. Pedersen,esbenwp@diku.dk,"1. J. Alexander, J. Kildal, K. HornbÃ_k, V.

We study force-sensitive tapping using Expressive Touch, a tabletop interface that infers tapping force from the sound waves created by the usersâ€™ finger upon impact. The first part of the paper describes the implementation details of Expressive Touch and shows how existing tabletop interfaces can be augmented to reliably detect tapping force across the entire surface. The second part of the paper reports on the results of three studies of force-sensitive tapping. First, we use a classic psychophysic task to gain insights into participantsâ€™ perception of tapping force (Study 1). Results show that although participants tap with different absolute tapping forces, they have a similar perception of relative tapping force. Second, we investigate participantsâ€™ ability to control tapping force (Study 2) and find that users can produce two force levels with 99% accuracy. For six levels of force, accuracy drops to 58%. Third, we investigate the usability of force tapping by studying participantsâ€™ reactions to seven force-sensitive touch applications (Study 3).",Paper,Esben W. Pedersen,esbenwp@diku.dk,"1. S.

While previous work has mostly addressed search, visualization and sense-making tasks, we have designed an abstract classification task that involves explicit data manipulation. Based on our observations of real uses of a wall display, this task represents a large category of applications. We report on a controlled experiment that uses this task to compare physical navigation in front of a wall-size display with virtual navigation using pan-and-zoom on the desktop. Our main finding is a robust interaction effect between display type and task difficulty: while the desktop can be faster than the wall for simple tasks, the wall gains a sizable advantage as the task becomes more difficult. A follow-up study shows that other desktop techniques (overview+detail, lens) do not perform better than pan-and-zoom and are therefore slower than the wall for difficult tasks.",Paper,Can Liu,can.liu@lri.fr,"1.

There is large variation between individuals in how they structure and retrieve information from personal archives. These differences make it hard to develop general PIM tools. However we know little about the origins of these differences. We present two studies evaluating whether differences arise from personality traits, by exploring whether different personalities structure personal archives differently. The first exploratory study asks participants to identify PIM cues that signal personality traits. While the aim was to identify cues, these cues also proved surprisingly accurate indicators of personality. In a second study, to evaluate these cues, we directly measure relations between structure and traits. We demonstrate that Conscientiousness predicts file organization, particularly PC usersâ€™ desktops. Neurotic people may also keep more desktop files. One implication is that systems might be customized for different personalities. We also advance personality theory, showing that personal digital artifacts signal personality.

In response to this need, we present a novel sampling method based on two core ideas: a multiple regression model over language-independent features, and the statistical analysis of the corpus from which phrases will be drawn.

Today, fully automatic approaches are at hand for supporting users. \ They make use of pixel information extracted from the images, analyze contextual information such as capture time and focal aperture, or use both to determine a proper subset of photos. However, these approaches miss the most important factor in the photo selection process: the user. The goal of our approach is to consider individual interests. By recording and analyzing gaze information from the user's viewing photo collections, we obtain information on user's interests and use this information in the creation of personal photo selections. In a controlled experiment with 33 participants, we show that the selections can be significantly improved over a baseline approach by up to 22% when taking individual viewing behavior into account. We also obtained significantly better results for photos taken at an event participants were involved in compared with photos from another event. ",Paper,Tina Walber,walber@uni-koblenz.de,"1.

As requested, we have reworked the document and addressed comments raised by the reviewers. In addition, we have significantly improved the presentation. \  \ Below we respond to the meta-review comments as well as further individual reviewer comments: \  \ Question from the Meta-Review  \  \ Q: [â€_] the point of why people select photos.  \ A: We have added related work about the life cycle of photos to the â€œIntroductionâ€ù section. We payed particular attention to the motivation why people conduct photo selections and the relevance of the photo selection task in the life cycle (â€œselecting photos is a frequent taskâ€ù). \  \ Q: [â€_] serious attempt to improve the clarity and presentation of the results section in this paper. The results section is very difficult to digest and follow. [â€_]  \ A: We have reworked the results section. We now distinguish between findings on the user behavior (Section â€œUsers' Photo Viewing and Selection Behaviorâ€ù) and gaze-based selection results (Section â€œGaze Selection Resultsâ€ù). In the preambles of each sections, we give an overview of the presented content. \  \ Q: [â€_] basically the concern is that the authors have overlooked some core work on understanding how people 'enjoy' going through their photo collections (it's not all hard, painful work).  \ A: We have added related work to Section â€œIntroductionâ€ù, showing that the creation of a selection of photos is perceived as â€œcomplex and time consumingâ€ù for normal photo collections, while it could be a pleasure for special occasions. \ In addition, we added to the â€œDiscussionâ€ù section an explanation that gaze data alone will probably not be sufficient to make a â€œperfect selectionâ€ù. But it significantly improves over the state of the art. A photo management application might offer a feature that allows the users to create an (semi-)automatic selection just after viewing a set of photos. \  \ Q: R1 â€“ study setup: [â€_] I did find the experiment section a bit confusing. \ A: We rewrote the procedure section and paid particular attention to presenting the methodology applied in our experiment. We have added a new Figure 2, which illustrates this procedure. In the first step, the subjects are viewing the photos (here and only here we record gaze data). In the subsequent three steps, the subjects are performing three different manual photo selection tasks.  \  \ Q: R2/R3 - Results section/Stats (additional statistical analyses) \ A: We added the requested statistical analyses for the viewing and selection times to the new Section â€œUsers' Photo Viewing and Selection Behaviorâ€ù. In addition, we explain in Sections â€œMaterialsâ€ù and â€œSelection Results for Combined Measuresâ€ù why we used non-parametric tests in the analysis of the Likert scale results. To this end, we have added the results of the pre-tests performed to check the conditions of the parametric tests (see Shapiro-Wilk Test and Mauchly's Test). \   \ Q: R2 - I was wondering about intercorrelations among predictors and potential issues due to collinearity. \ A: We have added the results of the previously conducted pairwise Pearson's correlation tests in Section â€œSelection Results for Combined Measuresâ€ù for excluding strong correlations between the considered measures.  \  \ Q: [â€_] when would this 'free gazing' occur? In short, it's not clear that this is necessarily a good solution to the problem that you are aiming to tackle.     \ A: We have added an answer on this question to the â€œIntroductionâ€ù Section. \  \ Q: Figure 6, there are no labels for the x-axis of the chart. \ A: We have added labels to the x-axis of this chart (please note that Figure 6 is now Figure 7). In addition, we added some comments to the chart for an easier understanding of the depicted data. \  \ Q: Figures 8 and 10 only show numbers corresponding to the selection criteria and measures in the x-axis respectively, which makes it a bit difficult to follow.  \ A: The criteria and measures were added to the x-axis in Figure 8 (now Figure 9) and Figure 10 (now Figure 11). \  \ Q: R2 - Pixel distance vs visual angle: without any information on distance to screen (screen size is mentioned) it becomes difficult to get any idea about the actual visual angles involved.  \ A: We have added information about the visual angle degree for all pixel distances in Sections Procedure and Gaze Analysis. \  \ Q: R2 - Numbering of predictor variables: on page 5, top, variable numbers (14 - 19 & 1 - 13) are not in line with the numbering in Tables 1 & 2.  \ A: This error was fixed. \  \  \ Additional questions from Review 4  \  \ Q: [â€_] I found it hard to believe that an analysis of the 'sharpness' of the image would predict how likely it was that  someone would like the photo. [â€_] I felt that a little more could have been done in the related work section to show how well these measures work, or how popular they are in use. \ A: The sharpness measure is used in the related work for conducting fully-automatic photo selections (e.g., Xiao et al. and Boll et al.). Also Rodden and Wood (CHI 2003) mention technical poorness of photos as selection criteria such as sharpness. \ In addition, our participants rated the photo selection criterium regarding quality (â€œthe photo is clear, not blurry, good exposureâ€ù) as their third most important criteria (out of 9 proposed criteria).  \  \ Q: The analyses of pp. 7/8 seem to be in the wrong order â€“ what we have here is going from a detailed view (pp. 7) back out to a big view (pp. 8). [â€_] \ A: We better explain the order. In the first step, we investigate merely single measures (no machine learning). Only in the second step, we look at the combination of several measures using logistic regression. \  \ Q: The problem is when we come to eye-tracking data [â€_] we learn that it comes down to gaze duration [â€_]. What troubles me though is that this main point is never really articulated very clearly. \ A: We have added a clear statement to the â€œDiscussionâ€ù section. \  \ Q: A bigger concern comes from trying to understand why participants might have looked for longer at photos that were selected. It might be the case that the act of selecting a photo simply requires it to be looked at for longer (i.e., in order to select it with the mouse). [â€_] \ A: We have added a clearer description of the experiment procedure, including a diagram describing the steps (Figure 2, Section â€œProcedureâ€ù). The viewing phase and the phase when selecting the photos are two separate steps. \  \ Additional questions from Review 5 \  \ Q: [â€_] photo selection, particularly selection for other people, is a labour of love. [â€_] I wanted to see a discussion of this, or at least a critical comparison of these different approaches and what the pros and cons are somewhere in the paper.   \ A: We well acknowledge that â€œputting together collections for other people, or even for oneself is a processâ€ù that is also pleasurable and can provide a big personal payoff (see above). Details on this have been added to the â€œIntroductionâ€ù section.  \  \ Q: (Baseline Measures) Are any of these combined measures better than chance (or not)?  \ A: In Section â€œComputing Precision Pâ€ù, we show that the precision results for a random selection would be on average 0.33. Thus, all baseline measures perform better than the baseline approaches, although the difference is small for some measures. The combined baseline measures without gaze data reach a precision of P= 0.365.  \  \ Q: Were the participants themselves at the events in question?   \ A: As described in Section â€œMaterialsâ€ù, we have two photo sets taken at two events of two research groups (one in Europe and one in Northern America). In the experiment, the people participating in these events viewed both photo sets. Thus, while there is one photo set the participants were familiar with (as they participated in the event; called in this context the â€œHome Setâ€ù), the other photo set was unfamiliar to the participants (as it covered events from the other research group; called then â€œForeign Setâ€ù). \  \ Additional questions from Review 1 \  \ Q: When would this browsing [of photos] occur in practice? When photos are imported into the library in the first place? At a later stage? \ A: We have added information on this in the â€œIntroductionâ€ù section. \  \ Additional questions from Review 3 \  \ Q: [â€_] literature about how people make decision on the photo selection. \ A: We have added relevant literature in this area suggested by the reviewers as well as new works discovered by additional literature research. \  \ Q: It would be nice to see how much the performance of the automatic photo selection based â€œONLYâ€ù on the eye gaze information can improve or deteriorate?  \ A: Selection Se is based only on gaze data (see Section â€œSelection Results for Combined Measuresâ€ù and Figure 12). The results are good and comparable to the results combining gaze and baseline measures. \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \ ",,Tina Walber,Ansgar Scherp,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 9:46,pn419,A,Food Messaging: Using Edible Medium for Social Messaging,Jun,Wei,weijun24@nus.edu.sg,pn0419-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Jun Wei, Xiaojuan Ma, Shengdong Zhao","weijun24@nus.edu.sg, xiaojuan.c.ma@gmail.com, shengdong.zhao@gmail.com",28819,Jun,,Wei,weijun24@nus.edu.sg,NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering,National University of Singapore,Singapore,,Singapore,,,,,,11838,Xiaojuan,,Ma,xiaojuan.c.ma@gmail.com,Noah's Ark Lab,Noah's Ark Lab,Hong Kong,Hong Kong,China,,,,,,3430,Shengdong,,Zhao,shengdong.zhao@gmail.com,,National University of Singapore,Singapore,,Singapore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Food is more than just a means of survival; it is also a form of communication. In this paper, we investigate the potential of food as a social message carrier (a.k.a., food messaging). To investigate how people accept, use, and perceive food messaging, we conducted exploratory interviews, a field study, and follow-up interviews over four weeks in a large information technology (IT) company. We collected 904 messages sent by 343 users. Our results suggest strong acceptance of food messaging as an alternative message channel. Further analysis implies that food messaging embodies characteristics of both text messaging and gifting. It is preferred in close relationships for its evocation of positive emotions.

The companyâ€™s size also enabled us to test the application in a variety of social relationships, and also users with different backgrounds (e.g. engineers, staff, etc)."" \  \ â€¢	Transparency to employee's managers and bearing on employee's roles and job (R2); Clarification of the printing / delivery setup (R3) \ We added the following sentence on page 5, last paragraph of the section Food Messaging Service:  \ ""With managerial approval, we opened the message pick-up counter in the employeesâ€™ canteen during lunch (12-1pm) and dinner (5:30-6:30pm), so as not to interfere with regular working hours."" \ We added the following sentence on page 5, 1st paragraph of the section Data Collection: \ ""On average, senders used 6 min. to submit a message and complete the survey online. There were no complaints about the process."" \  \ â€¢	Details of food (R3) \ We added the following sentence on page 4, paragraph 2 under the section Food Messaging Service:  \  ""The icing sheets, made from starch and sugar, have a sweet taste and a creamy aroma."" \  \ â€¢	How long in average did recipient collect their food message (R3, R5) \ We added the following sentence on page 4, paragraph 2 under the section Food Messaging Service: \ ""Each message was sealed in a plastic bag and ready for collection within a half day of request receipt. Twice daily, we sent a reminder email indicating the next available collection time and location. Printed food messages were kept up to 10 days for collection before being disregarded."" \  \ 3)	Interpretation of the finding  \  \ â€¢	Coding issue and unclear data inclusion for the analysis (R2) \ We added the following sentence on page 5 under the section Coding Process:  \ ""In other words, each coder could only assign one subcategory to each message... We computed the agreement on all the messages including the 30 training items at the subcategory level. We did not include the undecided 75 messages in the final analysis, because we decided they might be semantically ambiguous, making it difficult to interpret senders' intentions."" \  \ â€¢	Recipients' dealing with the cookies (R3) \ We added the following sentence on page 8, paragraph 3 under the section Impacts of Physical Properties:  \  ""Our data show receivers, especially females, opted not to eat food messages immediately. Some even expressed the interest of preserving the message. They first took photos, displayed messages on their desks, or kept them in the refrigerator."" \  \  \ â€¢	Whether recipients follow up with the sender after receiving a food message (R3) \ We added the following sentence on page 8, paragraph 6 under the section Impacts of Social and Emotional Properties:  \ ""In our data, many users wrote back via food messaging. Interviewees also mentioned using conventional channels (phone calls, online chat) to contact senders, similar to gift giving communication. This suggests food messaging can facilitate social dynamics and rebuild social connections."" \  \ â€¢	The question is what ""everyday communication"" means in the study (R1) \ We added the following sentence on page 2, last paragraph of the section Background and Related Work:  \ ""Which includes both practical and emotional communication, according to peopleâ€™s communication needs."" \  \ â€¢	Clarify ""more easily"" (end of Discussion section) (R2) \ We have changed this to ""to those they care for, in a fashion that combines traditional gift giving and messaging"" to clarify the meaning on Page 9. \  \ 4)	Depth of analysis  \   \ â€¢	More analysis should be done on the motivational factors for using food messaging other than just curiosity (R1). \ We added a Motivation section in the Discussion part on page 9 to illustrate the motivational factors based on food messages' physical and emotional impacts, and people's communication needs, which haven't been satisfied by current messaging methods. (Please see in the paper) \  \ â€¢	Elaborate more on how different types of food may differ in serving communication purposes (R2) \ We added the following sentence on page 10, paragraph 5 under the section Implications for Future Design, combining it with the discussion about Mcluhan's saying:  \ ""Every food could carry different meanings based on its color, texture, smell and taste. Chocolate means love and intimacy, while fruit may be translated as health and fresh."" \  \ â€¢	Discussion on the impact of Chinese culture on gift-giving within the context of food messaging in this study (R3). More discussion on the differences between gift-giving and sending food messages in this context (R1, R2). \ We added content on page 9, paragraph 2, 3, 4 under the section Implications for Future Design (Please see in the paper) \  \ â€¢	Further discuss the food messaging niche in the world of social messaging and gift giving (R2)  \ We added the following sentences on page 6, paragraph 1 under the section Gender Bias to compare with literatures on gender differences of gift giving. \ ""It may also result from the gender differences on attitudes and behaviors of gift giving. It is indicated that, ""women are more likely to possess a positive orientation towards gift giving, and they are largely responsible for the practice of giving [32]."" \  \ We also added content on page 8, paragraph 1,3,5 under the section Impacts of the Physical Properties (Please see in the paper) \  \ â€¢	Further, explicitly, unpack McLuhan in your discussion rather than just reference him at the end (R2) \ We added more discussion on this point and combined it with interviewee's suggestion that send food message using typical cultural foods on page 10, paragraph 5 under the section Implications for Future Design. (Please see in the paper) \  \ â€¢	More discussion on the ""Food goes into body"" perspective (R2) \ We added the sentences on page 7, 1st paragraph of Impacts of Physical Properties: \ ""Recipients could better sense such emotional expression via consumption of the edible messages. This triggers a multimodal sensational and emotional response and the taste of food nicely complements the meaning of the message [5]. Different type of foods can be combined with different types of messages to create enriched and unique experiences."" \  \ â€¢	Limitation of the current service and potential effect of operatorâ€™s access to messages (R5) \ We added the following information on page 10, last paragraph of the section Implications for Future Design.  \ ""Although the service in this study did not support 3D printing or full automation of messages delivery, the insights were informative. Our participants did not seem to be concerned about the access of message content by the operator as the content typically does not contain much sensitive information. The privacy concern can be further mitigated when food messaging service becomes further expedited and automated, when mainstream food printers were marketed for use at work and home with higher efficiency. Moreover, a 3D food printer would bring an additional expressive dimension in designing the shape and look of food messages, which can be further investigated in future research."" \  \ â€¢	More emphasis on how ingesting a message was different from just reading it (R5) \ We added the following sentence on page 8, paragraph 3 under the section Impacts of Physical Properties:  \  ""Digesting the messages also reinforce recipients to memorize the content by heart since they cannot be reprocessed once consumed.""  \  \ â€¢	Usage of 2D printer on icing sheets in the study instead of 3D printing on food (R5) \ We addressed this by adding the following sentences to the beginning of the methodology section on page 3 to point out that we have used the Canon 2D food printer.  \ ""Concerning the potential issues of robustness, efficiency and operation complexity of our current 3D food printer prototype, we employed the commercially available Canon MG5320 edible printer that is capable of printing edible messages on supreme icing sheets (Figure 2) in the field study."" \ It is again mentioned on page 5 when we talk about the apparatus of the field study. \ ",,Jun Wei,Shengdong Zhao,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:59,pn420,A,Is Motion Capture-Based Biomechanical Simulation Valid for HCI Studies?

The method is presently gaining ground in sports, medicine, and industrial ergonomics, but it also bears great potential for studies in HCI where the physical ergonomics of a design is important. To make the method more broadly accessible, we study its predictive validity for movements and users typical to studies in HCI. We discuss the sources of error in biomechanical simulation and present results from two validation studies conducted with a state-of-the-art system. Study I tested aimed movements ranging from multitouch gestures to dancing, finding out that the critical limiting factor is the size of movement. Study II compared muscle activation predictions to surface-EMG recordings in a 3D pointing task. The data shows medium-to-high validity that is, however, constrained by some characteristics of the movement and the user. \ We draw concrete recommendations to practitioners and discuss challenges to developing the method further.",Paper,Antti Oulasvirta,antti.oulasvirta@mpii.de,"1.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive user study with 40 participants, in which we systematically compared the Pinch-Drag-Flick approach with a technique that relies on spatial manipulation, such as lifting a display up/down to zoom. While we solely considered known techniques, we put considerable effort in implementing both input strategies on popular consumer hardware (iPhone, iPad). Our results show that spatial manipulation can significantly outperform traditional Pinch-Drag-Flick.

This work has unveiled that people show strong signs of prospective motor planning, i.e., they choose initial grasps that avoid uncomfortable end postures and facilitate object manipulation. Interactive tabletops allow their users great flexibility in the manipulation of virtual objects but to our knowledge previous work has never examined whether prospective motor control takes place in this context. To test this, we ran three experiments. We systematically studied how users adapt their grasp when asked to translate and rotate virtual objects on a multitouch tabletop. Our results demonstrate that target position and orientation significantly affect the orientation of finger placement on the object. We analyze our results in the light of the most recent model of planning for manipulating physical objects and identify their implications for the design of tabletop interfaces. \ ",Paper,Halla Olafsdottir,halla@lri.fr,"1.

Our hardware comprises of low-resolution matrix of infrared (IR) proximity sensors interspersed between the keys of a regular mechanical keyboard. This results in coarse but high frame-rate motion data. We extend a machine learning algorithm, traditionally used for static classification only, to robustly support dynamic, temporal gestures. We propose the use of motion signatures a technique that utilizes pairs of motion history images and a random forest based classifier to robustly recognize a large set of motion gestures on and directly above the keyboard. Our technique achieves a mean per-frame classification accuracy of 75.6% in leave-one-subject-out and 89.9% in half-test/half-training cross-validation. We detail our hardware and gesture recognition algorithm, provide performance and accuracy numbers, and demonstrate a large set of gestures designed to be performed with our device.

Presents design guidelines for childrenâ€™s search interfaces.,"We addressed the reviewersâ€™ revision requests as follows. We added the research question and justified the comparison between children and adults more explicitly in the text. We referenced the recent work of Druin et al. as suggested by the meta reviewer. We added information about how the participants sample was selected. We also acknowledged the bias due to the fact that the majority of adults in the study were in the IT field.  \ The results section was restructured and the results are now grouped by the search engine they apply for. We rephrased the sentence in Conclusion to be more explicit that these recommendations are based on this study using â€œBased on the findings of this study we provide the following suggestionsâ€_â€ù  \ We followed suggestions of R1 and R2 on the organization and used subheadings.  \ Figure 2 comes before Figure 3 in the paper now (was also wished by R3). Figures 1a and 1b are correctly labelled now. We have broken lengthy paragraphs apart (was also wished by R3). We corrected the presentation of the elements of the Blinde-Kuh search engine. They appear now in sequential order in the text. Unnecessary subheading â€œheat mapsâ€ù is removed.  We absorbed the text of Subheading Organization into the preceding and subsequent sections. We added references for the statements â€œAdults most frequently employ navigational searchâ€ù and â€œthey are only superficially familiar with web search engines.â€ù   \ We also took all the detailed comments of R2 into account and improved the language, rephrased and added missing information. For example, the sentence â€œWe also found that adults should not use search engines targeted for children to avoid frustrationâ€ù was removed; details about Internet usage added â€œ80% of fourth grade and 33% of third grade children use the Internet at least once a week.â€ù ",,Tatiana Gossen,Andreas NÃ_rnberger,,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/10/14 8:31,pn435,A,Show Me the Invisible: Visualizing Hidden Content,Thomas,Geymayer,geymayer@icg.tugraz.at,pn0435-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Thomas Geymayer, Markus Steinberger, Alexander Lex, Marc Streit, Dieter Schmalstieg","geymayer@icg.tugraz.at, steinberger@icg.tugraz.at, alex@seas.harvard.edu, marc.streit@jku.at, schmalstieg@tugraz.at",35577,Thomas,,Geymayer,geymayer@icg.tugraz.at,,Graz University of Technology,Graz,,Austria,,,,,,17097,Markus,,Steinberger,steinberger@icg.tugraz.at,,Graz University of Technology,Graz,,Austria,,,,,,35758,Alexander,,Lex,alex@seas.harvard.edu,,Harvard University,Cambridge,Massachusetts,United States,,,,,,35757,Marc,,Streit,marc.streit@jku.at,,Johannes Kepler University Linz,Linz,,Austria,,,,,,11802,Dieter,,Schmalstieg,schmalstieg@tugraz.at,,Graz University of Technology,Graz,,Austria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Content on computer screens is often inaccessible to users because it is hidden, e.g., occluded by other windows, outside the viewport, or overlooked. In search tasks, the efficient retrieval of sought content is important. Current software, however, only provides limited support to visualize hidden occurrences and rarely supports search synchronization crossing application boundaries. To remedy this situation, we introduce two novel visualization methods to guide users to hidden content. \ Our first method generates awareness for occluded or out-of-viewport content using see-through visualization. For content that is either outside the screen's viewport or for data sources not opened at all, our second method shows off-screen indicators and an on-demand smart preview. To reduce the chances of overlooking content, we use visual links, i.e., visible edges, to connect the visible content or the visible representations of the hidden content. \ We show the validity of our methods in a user study, which demonstrates that our technique enables a faster localization of hidden content compared to traditional search functionality and thereby assists users in information retrieval tasks.",Paper,Thomas Geymayer,geymayer@icg.tugraz.at,"1.

However, controlled and rigorous HCI research is needed to understand the basic characteristics of perception of this new feedback medium, and so how best to utilise ultrasonic haptics in an interface. This paper describes two experiments conducted into two fundamental aspects of ultrasonic haptic perception: 1) localisation of a static point and 2) the perception of motion. Understanding these would provide insight into 1) the spatial resolution of an ultrasonic interface and 2) what forms of feedback give the most convincing illusion of movement. Results show an average localisation error of 8.5mm, with higher error along the longitudinal axis. Convincing sensations of motion were produced when travelling longer distances, using longer stimulus durations and stimulating multiple points along the trajectory.

Please note we already included StorySurfer as part of talking about the Interactive Childrenâ€™s Library Project. This was also suggested as additional literature. \  \ DESIGN PROCESS (p3): \ - Although it was not picked up explicitly by the reviewers as something to fix, we felt there was some ambiguity at the start of the DESIGN PROCESS section regarding the purpose of the initial workshop. We have rewritten much of the text on p3 to clarify this. \  \ DEPARTMENT OF HIDDEN STORIES (p5): \ - At the start of p5 we now explain how creating DoHS as a digital game presented clear advantages over the card-based storytelling game that was created for the pilot study. \ - We have also adjusted the flow of the text on this page to forefront the interactive techniques we made us of in the DoHS app before discussing the two game modes. \  \ PILOT STUDY (p4): \ - We have added additional information about the ages of the children participating in the study and how they represented a diverse range of literacy proficiency.  \  \ THE STUDY (p5-6): \ - On p5-6 we have added additional detail to describe the approach of coding the themes into some more detail adding some of the specific themes seen at earlier stages. \  \ CONCLUSION (p9): \ - We acknowledge how the childrenâ€™s reactions may be biased by their involvement in the earlier workshop, and note this as a limitation of the work. However we stress that we were reporting about an iterative design process which lead to digital game, rather than presenting a comparative study between a card-based game and the digital game. We also describe that how we have not over generalised our findings in order to present a rich understanding of the childrenâ€™s behaviors and responses to playing the game. \ - We have briefly mentioned the value our library partners got from the project and how we are performing ongoing work with other libraries. \  \ ADDITIONAL: \ - In response to the accessibility report we have now create alt text for all images in the document and ensured the tables are formatted correctly if a different format of display is used. \ - We have altered the dimensions and contrast of Figure 3 to ensure it is readable both on screen and when printed. \ - The final version has been copy-edited and the text has been tightened throughout to aid reading and avoid repetition. \ ",games,Gavin Wood,John Vines,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:20,pn444,A,Recreating Living Experiences from Past Memories through Virtual Worlds for People with Dementia,Chee Siang,Ang,csa8@kent.ac.uk,pn0444-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Panote Siriaraya, Chee Siang Ang","spanote@gmail.com, csa8@kent.ac.uk",37516,Panote,,Siriaraya,spanote@gmail.com,School of Engineering and Digital Arts,University of Kent,Canterbury,Kent,United Kingdom,,,,,,5834,Chee Siang,,Ang,csa8@kent.ac.uk,School of Engineering and Digital Arts,University of Kent,Canterbury,Kent,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper describes a study aimed to understand the use of 3D virtual world (VW) technology to support life engagement for people with dementia in long-term care.

Testing and revising prototypes iteratively gave insights related to design issues. ,"We would like to thank the reviewers for the constructive comments. Below are the corrections carried out in response to each of the reviews which have been suggested. All the revised sections were highlighted in green in the main text. \  \ Literature review \  \ 1. Add a 2-3 paragraph section on Caring for People with Dementia where you discuss the variability of dementia, the potential impact, and the Intensive Interaction work mentioned by R4, and mention the pressures on carers highlighted by R4 \ We have expanded the section on dementia and old age. In particular, we have discussed more about the variability of the symptoms and the impact of dementia for those who have the condition. In addition, we have added another paragraph about intensive interaction, the challenge in caring for dementia and the pressures on carers. Please see the highlighted text in page 1 and 2. \  \ 2.  In the Section on Technology in Dementia Care, add a paragraph where you discuss more explicitly how your work relates to work on reminiscence systems such as CIRCA. You need to make the difference between these systems and virtual worlds very clear, and clarify why it is important to study this technology separately, in particular given the clear user interface differences between CIRCA and your virtual worlds \  \ We have added a paragraph within the â€œVirtual worlds and their potential in dementia careâ€ù section (Please see the highlighted text in page 2) to discuss more explicitly how the approach we adopted in our system is different from other previous systems (such as CIRCA). \  \  \ Methodology \  \ 3. Please state at the beginning of the methodology section that the design of the Virtual Worlds evolved iteratively in consultation with carers and based on observations of residents, and provide a table that summarises each iteration of the VW prototype and the main reasons for changing the design. \ We have emphasised that the prototypes emerged iteratively at the first paragraph in the method section (Please see the highlighted text in page 2). We have also added sentences highlighting the key design changes and the motivation for the changes in each iteration. Please refer to table 2 in page 4.  \  \ 4. Please provide an overview table that shows for each of the 8 sessions how many carers were involved, at which care home they took place, and roughly how many residents were involved. \ We have added a table to provide more details about the visits and observation sessions which were carried out (Table 1). We have also provided further clarification in regards to the number of visits and observation sessions and focus group studies carried out. Please refer to the highlighted text in page 2-3 in the method section. \  \ 5. Explain whether the focus groups and interviews had a schedule, or whether they were free, based on observations. \ More information about the interviews and the focus groups has been added to the method section. The interviews were open-ended and usually involve a discussion of the intervieweeâ€™s opinions towards the prototypes, a suggestion on ways to improve it and clarification on some of the observations. The focus groups were structured around discussing the issues (problems etc) encountered in the earlier prototypes (a number of issues that were observed were prepared beforehand and this guided the focus group session) and then discussing ideas to improve them and also a discussion to find the best type of content and activity to use. Please refer to the highlighted text in page 2-3.  \  \ 6. Note how many people conducted the thematic analysis and how the coding evolved and was checked \ We have expanded the section about thematic analysis in the â€œData collection & Analysisâ€ù section to provide more information about how the thematic analysis was carried out. Please refer to the highlighted text in page 3. \  \ 7. When you describe the Virtual Worlds, make sure that you either add the motivation for the changes in each version, or point to the part of the study where that specific iteration is described \ Table 2 in page 4 has been added to highlight the key changes and the motivation for change in each of the iteration. We combined the motivation for change within the table describing the key changes to save space.  \  \ 8. Add a sentence that explains why you did not design for users in wheelchairs - what about users that use Zimmer frames or crutches? \ In the initial prototype, we wanted to utilize the full ability of the Kinect to detect the full range of user interactions (movement in ten joints which included head, neck arm and leg movements) and map them to the virtual worlds. However, it quickly transpired from the observation sessions that apart from exhausting the participants, this also excluded participants in wheelchairs and limited the experience for those who have difficulty in moving (such as those relying on Zimmer frames for movements). As such, the second prototype onwards (Virtual tour and gardening prototypes) utilized only movement from the usersâ€™ arms and hands, thus being more inclusive to residents in wheelchairs. We have added this discussion to the â€œVirtual world prototypesâ€ù section. Please see the highlighted text in page 3. \ As for residents with arm crutches or those having difficulty in moving their arms, this still remains a limitation in systems which use gesture-based interaction. Although, we did design our system to work with the keyboard which could be controlled by a career, users could feel less in control and this could limit their experience.   We have highlighted this limitation in the discussion section in page 9. \  \ Findings \  \ 9. When you say that something was ""commonly observed"", say how often it was observed across sessions. \ We recorded such instances in five of the observation sessions. We have added this to the findings in page 5. \  \ 10. Omit the paragraph ""The residentsâ€™ memories of objects that form the settings of the narrative of themselves cannot be easily [â€_.] VW may be the second best option for these residents."" And move the note into a paragraph below the one that begins ""VWs containing objects"" . How many notes do you have that show women enjoying the garden and men enjoying the cars? How many people interacted with the virtual Safari. \ The suggested paragraph has been omitted. The note has been moved to the following paragraph. Please see page 5. We have provided more specific details about those who enjoyed interacting with the garden and the park prototype and the number of male residents who did not and also the number of male residents who were said to enjoy cars. A total of 9 residents interacted with the river tour prototype (virtual safari).  \  \ 11. Tone down the following paragraph ""Indeed, newer studies looking into the use of virtual reality and dementia found that despite having cognitive disabilities[â€_.] VW could provide a safe and low cost environment for residents to experience and relive their memory."" All you need to say is that this finding is interesting and needs to be investigated further and related to the degree to which specific abilities, such as theory of mind, are preserved. \ We have toned down the statement in the paragraph and have suggested how the finding raises an interesting research question which needs to be investigated. Please see the highlighted text in page 6. \  \ 12.  ""Another important implication of the â€œwonderland effectâ€ù was that it provided an environment for the residents to break away from the routine of the ordinary."" / ""The wonderland approach we adopted in particular (through the use of bright colours and particle effects) helped enhance this feeling of positivity."" Substantiate this with a field note or leave it out. The rest of the paragraphs where these sentences appear is fine. \ Due to the addition information (Tables, Paragraphs in the literature review, citations and references etc) added to the paper, we have decided to remove both paragraphs to save space. \ ",,Chee Siang Ang,Panote Siriaraya,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/16/14 11:50,pn455,A,"End-Users Publishing Structured Information on the Web: An Observational Study of What, Why, and How",Edward,Benson,eob@csail.mit.edu,pn0455-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Edward Benson, David R Karger","eob@csail.mit.edu, karger@mit.edu",27376,Edward,,Benson,eob@csail.mit.edu,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,Massachusetts,United States,,,,,,5265,David,R,Karger,karger@mit.edu,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,Massachusetts,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"  End-users are accustomed to filtering and browsing styled collections of data \   on professional web sites, but they have few ways to create and publish such \   information architectures for themselves.

Although there have been advances in digitizer technology over the last few years, commercial end-to-end latencies are unfortunately similar to those found with touchscreens, i.e., 65 - 120 milliseconds. We report on a prototype stylus-enabled device, the High Performance Stylus System (HPSS), designed to display latencies as low as one millisecond while users ink or perform dragging tasks.  \  \ To understand the role of latency while inking with a stylus, psychophysical just-noticeable difference experiments were conducted using the HPSS. While participants performed dragging and scribbling tasks, very low levels of latency could be discriminated, i.e., ~1 versus 2 milliseconds while dragging and ~7 versus 40 milliseconds while scribbling. The HPSS and our experimentation have provided further motivation for the implementation of latency saving measures in pen-based hardware and software systems. \ ",Paper,Michelle Annett,mkannett@gmail.com,"1.

However, the workers' performance might deteriorate due to stress. We argue that informing biofeedback to the instructor, can improve communication and lead to lower stress. This paper presents a thorough investigation on mental workload and stress perceived by twenty participants, paired up in an instructor-worker scenario, performing remote video-mediated tasks. The interface conditions differ in task, facial and biofeedback communication. Two self-report measures are used to assess mental workload and stress. Results show that pairs reported lower mental workload and stress when instructors are using the biofeedback as compared to using interfaces with facial view. Significant correlations were found on task performance with reducing stress (i.e. increased task engagement and decreased worry) for instructors and declining mental workload (i.e. increased performance) for workers.

Many of the revisions have addressed grammatical errors and misspelling, or have been to improve the readability of the paper, and do not warrant description here.  The key revisions are as follows: \  \ 1)	Removal of the discussion Garfinkel, Heath and health informatics (from the abstract, Personal Informatics section, and end). \ 2)	Inclusion of references to Newman et al (in the Sociality of Personal Tracking section) and to McCarthy and Wright (in the Discussion). \ 3)	Softening and clarification of our stance towards Li et al (in multiple sections â€“ in particular Personal Informatics and Discussion). \ 4)	Revision of Abstract and Introduction to clarify the content of the paper and for readability. \ 5)	Revision of the Discussion for readability and clarification (in particular removing the discussion of â€œtextureâ€ù, and placing emphasis on â€œthe felt lifeâ€ù).  \ 6)	Revisions to the Findings section, including emphasis that the styles of activity tracking are overlapping, and the renaming of the fifth style. Note: we explored alternative structures for the findings section, but found no alternative to be clearer and therefore decided to concentrate on improving the text and to include signposting in the introduction. \ 7)	We have included a note that the self selection issue may relate to the participants using multiple trackers (Interweaving section), and have noted that long term use may be desirable and valuable (Discussion). Reviewer 5 raised further arguments to do with long/short term tracking - we have tried to strike a balance rather than try to please one reviewer or another. \ 8)	We have made some modifications to the shading and line widths of the table. \  \ We have found the reviews (including the new review 5) very helpful and feel we have been able to improve the paper.  We hope that these changes are satisfactory. \ ",,John Rooksby,Mattias Rost,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:23,pn495,A,Gaze Gestures and Haptic Feedback in Mobile Devices,Jari,Kangas,jari.a.kangas@gmail.com,pn0495-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Jari Kangas, Deepak Akkil, Jussi Rantala, Poika Isokoski, PÃ_ivi Majaranta, Roope Raisamo","jari.kangas@uta.fi, deepak.akkil@uta.fi, jussi.e.rantala@uta.fi, poika.isokoski@uta.fi, paivi.majaranta@uta.fi, rr@cs.uta.fi",29501,Jari,,Kangas,jari.kangas@uta.fi,Tampere Unit for Computer-Human Interaction,University of Tampere,Tampere,,Finland,,,,,,37224,Deepak,,Akkil,deepak.akkil@uta.fi,Tampere Unit for Computer-Human Interaction,University of Tampere,Tampere,,Finland,,,,,,10918,Jussi,,Rantala,jussi.e.rantala@uta.fi,Tampere Unit for Computer-Human Interaction,University of Tampere,Tampere,,Finland,,,,,,1262,Poika,,Isokoski,poika.isokoski@uta.fi,Tampere Unit for Computer-Human Interaction,University of Tampere,Tampere,,Finland,,,,,,1251,PÃ_ivi,,Majaranta,paivi.majaranta@uta.fi,Tampere Unit for Computer-Human Interaction,University of Tampere,Tampere,,Finland,,,,,,1243,Roope,,Raisamo,rr@cs.uta.fi,Tampere Unit for Computer-Human Interaction,University of Tampere,Tampere,,Finland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anticipating the emergence of gaze tracking capable mobile devices, we are investigating the use of gaze as an input modality in handheld mobile devices.

Such adoption is paradoxical, however, as past research has repeatedly shown major co-organizational barriers; teams cannot agree a common organizational scheme, making it difficult to retrieve information organized by others. Another barrier is email competition; email provides a reliable alternative for distributing files that are then personally organized. To address this paradox, we explored how 27 participants actively using shared repositories overcome these barriers in a qualitative study. We found teams addressed co-organization using 4 strategies. First they create ContentMaps that provide explicit structure to organize shared information. Participants also co-organize using implicit strategies based on task structure, expertise, and tool affordances. Greater shared repository use also leads to a changed role for email. Versioning problems mean email is not used for distributing attachments, instead for task management. We present technical implications suggesting how new tools might be better integrated with email facilitating these continued email uses.

","Change document paper 514 \  \ As requested we have made the changes proposed by the reviewers and agreed in the final post committee reviews \  \ 1.	Novelty: We add material to the abstract, intro and discussion motivating the need to understand how shared repositories are being used successfully. In the intro we describe how prior work exclusively documents problems with shared repositories which fails to explain how and why such repositories are being increasingly adopted. In the discussion we describe these successful strategies we have identified. \   \ 2.	Technical Implications: in the discussion we discuss technical modifications to both email and repositories that could make them easier and more successful for participants to deploy. These include modifications to repositories to include ContentMaps, ContentMaps being standard email templates, automatic implicit indexing and communications information being integrated into repositories.  \   \ 3.	Results and Discussion. We clarify our findings on email, showing that although collaborative tools reduce attachment sharing, they increase overall email traffic with information about task management and alerting. This increased traffic may potentially lead to collaborative messages being overlooked. \  \ 4.	Outstanding empirical questions: we have added to the discussion, questions that arise from our work, including scalability, relations between email and shared repositories, and the role of leadership. \  \ 5.	Minor points: we have also rephrased our findings concerning adoption, â€˜novelâ€™ uses of collaborative tools, and on pages 5 and 7 added details about how ContentMaps serve to co-organize and assist with retrieval.  \  \ ",,Charlotte Massey,Steve Whittaker,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:51,pn521,A,Wave to Me: User Identification Using Body Lengths and Natural Gestures,Eiji,Hayashi,ehayashi@cs.cmu.edu,pn0521-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Eiji Hayashi, Manuel Maas, Jason Hong","ehayashi@cs.cmu.edu, manuel.maas@gmx.de, jasonh@cs.cmu.edu",12813,Eiji,,Hayashi,ehayashi@cs.cmu.edu,Human-Computer Interaction Institute,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,37449,Manuel,,Maas,manuel.maas@gmx.de,,Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,Karlsruhe,,Germany,,,,,,1961,Jason,,Hong,jasonh@cs.cmu.edu,,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We introduce a body-based identification system that leverages individual differences in body segment lengths and hand waving gesture patterns. The system identifies users based on a two-second hand waving gesture captured by a Microsoft Kinect. To evaluate our system, we collected 8640 gesture measurements from 75 participants through two lab studies and a field study. In the first lab study, we evaluated the feasibility of our concept and basic properties of features to narrow down the design space. In the second lab study, our system achieved a 1% equal error rate in user identification among seven registered users after two weeks following initial registration. We also found that our system was robust even when lower body segments could not be measured because of occlusions. In the field study, our system achieved 0.5 to 1.6% equal error rates, demonstrating that the system also works well in ecologically valid situations.

Using semantic analysis techniques, we derived a taxonomy of the types of project updates created during campaigns, and found discrepancies between the design intent of a project update and the various uses in practice (e.g. social promotion).

We carefully revised the section ANALYZING UPDATES (RQ1) to address the concerns: \  \ (a) We added two paragraphs to provide a detailed explanation on why and how we apply LDA to our data at the sentence level. For example, we added â€œWe first attempted to perform LDA on the preprocessed text by treating each update as a document. However, we found that the resulting themes had too much overlap (i.e. many themes shared the same words), making the interpretation of the themes difficult. This is a known limitation of standard LDA. An alternative that has been applied in the text mining community is to decompose the document into finer granularities such as the sentence level in order to detect more specific topics and reduce the overlap [15]. Thus, we attempted to apply LDA at the sentence-level (each sentence was treated as a document)â€_â€ù \  \ Also, also the reference about sentence-level LDA [15] was added in the revision. \  \ (b) In order to help readers understand the reliability of the taxonomy, we added a paragraph describing how we performed human coding to examine the reliability of the taxonomy. For example, we added â€œTo verify the reliability of the produced taxonomy, we recruited two people to code a sample of the updates based on the taxonomy. First, the coders received training in which they were introduced to the categories, definitions, and examples in the taxonomy. They then coded updates on a small sample of the data and resolved disagreements. Then, they independently coded a random sample of 200 updates. There was good agreement between the coders and the dictionary-based method derived from the taxonomy with a Fleiss' kappa of 0.77.â€ù \  \ 2) R3 wanted to know about how to decide the order of the blocks in the regression. In the revision, we clearly described how the blocks were added to the regression model and emphasized that the order was not predefined by the authors. For example, in the first paragraph of section ASSOCIATION BETWEEN UPDATES & SUCCESS (RQ2), we added the following sentences: â€œSpecifically, the regression starts with no blocks in the model, tests the addition of each block using Nagelkerke RÂ_, adds the block that improves the model the most, and repeats this process for the remaining blocks. This allowed us to study which blocks were more important for the success of a campaign.â€ù \  \ 3) Based on R2â€™s suggestion, we revised examples in Table 1. For instance, for the New Reward category, we added the example â€œFor any contributions of $20 or more, here are [sic] your new bonus.â€ù Additional, similar revisions will be made to better communicate the taxonomy. For the Reminder category, we added the example â€œLess than 24 hours to go â€_ one last push and one last reminder.â€ù \  \ 4) The secondary AC (R5) and R2 suggested better contextualizing the findings. We cited all the suggested papers and revised the DESIGN IMPLICATIONS section. For example, we added â€œFrequent updates used to solicit support from funders reflect frequent communication used in social media to bridge social capital or gain other benefits [7]. Future work may examine how communication strategies (beyond update themes) in updates affect support from funders, similar to how the language used in online posts affects the likelihood of a reply [6].â€ù \  \ 5) Based on R3â€™s suggestion, we revised the ABSTRACT section to provide details on the findings. \  \ 6) Based on R2â€™s suggestion, we added the definition of â€œsuccessâ€ù on Kickstarter in the INTRODUCTION section. \  \ 7) Based on the secondary AC (R5) and R2â€™s suggestions, we revised Figure 1 to save space. \  \ 8) Based on the secondary AC (R5)â€™s suggestion, we changed ""initial, middle, and final phase"" to ""initial, middle, and final thirds"", and changed ""Update Representation V.S. Project Representation"" to ""Update Representation vs. Project Representation"". \  \ 9) We fixed the typo in Figure 4 (pointed out by R1).",IxSc,Anbang Xu,Anbang Xu,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 21:24,pn529,A,3D Printed Interactive Speakers,Yoshio,Ishiguro,ishiy@acm.org,pn0529-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Yoshio Ishiguro, Ivan Poupyrev","ishiy@acm.org, ivan.poupyrev@disneyresearch.com",16900,Yoshio,,Ishiguro,ishiy@acm.org,,Disney Research,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,35478,Ivan,,Poupyrev,ivan.poupyrev@disneyresearch.com,,Disney Research,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We propose technology for designing and manufacturing interactive 3D printed speakers. With the proposed technol-ogy, sound reproduction can easily be integrated into vari-ous objects at the design stage and little assembly is re-quired. The speaker can take the shape of anything from an abstract spiral to a rubber duck, opening new opportunities in product design. Furthermore, both audible sound and inaudible ultrasound can be produced with the same design, allowing for identifying and tracking 3D printed objects in space using common integrated microphones. The design of 3D printed speakers is based on electrostatic loudspeaker technology first explored in the early 1930s but not broadly applied until now. These speakers are simpler than common electromagnetic speakers, while allowing for sound repro-duction at 60 dB levels with arbitrary directivity ranging from focused to omnidirectional.

In the past two years, live streams of video games, on sites such as Twitch.tv, have become very popular. Live streams serve as meeting grounds for player communities. The Twitch streaming medium combines broadcast video with open IRC chat channels. In conjunction with gameplay, viewer participation and community building gain emphasis. Twitch streams range in size and nature, from intimate communities with fifty viewers, to massive broadcasts with tens of thousands. In this paper, we present an ethnographic investigation of the live streaming of video games on Twitch. \  \ We find that Twitch streams act as virtual third places, in which informal communities emerge, socialize, and participate. Over time, stream communities form around shared identities drawn from streams' contents and participants' shared experiences. We describe processes through which stream communities form, the motivations of members, and emergent issues in the medium. Finally, we draw from our findings to derive implications for design of live mixed-media environments to support participatory online communities. ",Paper,William A. Hamilton,bill@ecologylab.net,"1.

The device allows performers to interactively accompany themselves through pushing, leaning on and bending steel wires. The design was guided by the unique needs of the solo-singer, explored through autobiographical design and material explorations, some on stage, and later tested by other singers. We discuss how designing for opera and for the stage requires extraordinary durability and how opera performances can change with a bodily-oriented instrument such as The Vocal Chorder. Through a designerly exploration, we arrived at a device that offered (1) a tool for singers to take control over the rhythmical pace and overall artistic and aesthetic outcome of their performances, (2) an enriched sense of embodiment between their voice and the overall performance; and (3) a means to empower opera singers on stage.

We discuss how designing for opera and for the stage requires extraordinary durability. ,"Dear AC \ We have revised our paper on The Vocal Chorder, trying to take the wishes, suggestions and requests from you into account as much as we could. We decided to play down the claim in the title, and at the same time back up that very claim better within the paper. This we did with more citations by our participants, as well as with additional references (namely the critic David Littlejohn's reasoning on the various ages in opera and the ongoing changes in power structures; followed by Sandgren's dissertation on opera singers and health; as well as a pinch of thinking on the industrial ""Fach""-system and it's consequences for contemporary opera singers). \ Furthermore, we extended the parts on how the changes in orchestras throughout the ages have directly inflicted changes in vocal practice.  \ We tried to deepen the parts regarding the actual physical interaction for the singers, and how that changed and transformed their vocal practice. In addition, we did rub up some of the parts on the design itself, trying to deepen them a bit, as well as adding testimony from one of our participants on how her views on her own partaking in the operatic world actually did change as a consequence from participating in our work - all of which is building up to our revised finale/ conclusion.  \ At the end of the day, we kept our references to McCarthy & Wright, as we felt that it situates our thinking and aims quite well. Even though we found many of the suggested additional references inspiring and well-fitting for our paper, we realized that due to lack of additional space as well as due to the already present argumentation in the paper, we had to refrain from them. If you feel that the paper now is blatantly missing any of these, we will of course do a new try to tuck them in.  \ With sincere regards \ The Vocal Chorder Team/ Carl Unander-Scharin  \ ",artIx,Carl Unander-Scharin,Ã…sa Unander-Scharin,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 17:54,pn549,A,A Chair as Ubiquitous Input Device: Exploring Semaphoric Chair Gestures for Focused and Peripheral Interaction,Kathrin,Probst,kathrin.probst@fh-hagenberg.at,pn0549-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Kathrin Probst, David Lindlbauer, Michael Haller, Bernhard Schwartz, Andreas Schrempf","kathrin.probst@fh-hagenberg.at, david.lindlbauer@fh-hagenberg.at, haller@fh-hagenberg.at, bernhard.schwartz@fh-linz.at, andreas.schrempf@fh-linz.at",19938,Kathrin,,Probst,kathrin.probst@fh-hagenberg.at,Media Interaction Lab,University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria,Hagenberg,Upper Austria,Austria,,,,,,23098,David,,Lindlbauer,david.lindlbauer@fh-hagenberg.at,Media Interaction Lab,University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria,Hagenberg,Upper Austria,Austria,,,,,,3937,Michael,,Haller,haller@fh-hagenberg.at,Media Interaction Lab,University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria,Hagenberg,Upper Austria,Austria,,,,,,33922,Bernhard,,Schwartz,bernhard.schwartz@fh-linz.at,Department of Medical Engineering,University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria,Linz,Upper Austria,Austria,,,,,,16546,Andreas,,Schrempf,andreas.schrempf@fh-linz.at,Department of Medical Engineering,University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria,Linz,Upper Austria,Austria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"During everyday office work we are used to controlling our computers with keyboard and mouse, while the majority of our body remains unchallenged and the physical workspace around us stays largely unattended.

To better understand how people's visual preferences differ, we collected 2.4 million ratings of the visual appeal of websites from nearly 40 thousand participants of diverse backgrounds. We address several gaps in the knowledge about design preferences of previously understudied groups. Among other findings, our results show that the level of colorfulness and visual complexity at which visual appeal is highest strongly varies: Females, for example, liked colorful websites more than males. A high education level generally lowers this preference for colorfulness. Russians preferred a lower visual complexity, and Macedonians liked highly colorful designs more than any other country in our dataset. We contribute a computational model and estimates of peak appeal that can be used to support rapid evaluations of website design prototypes for specific target groups.  \ ",Paper,Katharina Reinecke,reinecke@umich.edu,"1.

A network of ten components has been designed, some of which had different interfaces and design approaches: from totem-like Trees for gathering around with RFID cards to playful Sparrows that react on whistle sounds. After implementing the urban game in two city neighborhoods, we investigated the impact of each of these components on their communities.

","- Clarified Interaction Amplification Framework:  \ The model is unable to predict interaction, but provides a language for comparing placement options, which enables to make such decision more consciously.  \  \ - Added non-participation:  \ The poll showed that a lack of time was the most common reasons for non-participation. Also, interviews revealed that the components and the weather conditions were not suit to the physical needs of elderly.  \ Future focus group sessions with these groups are expected to give insight to their needs and preferences and could become a point of entry into their local community networks. \  \ - Added that participation is not for everyone:  \ Such interventions, although not for everyone (some prefer anonymity), can benefit the community at large [3].  \  \ - Added the design workflow:  \ Such interventions, although not for everyone (some prefer anonymity), can benefit the community at large. \  \ - Clarified the difference between recurring gameplay and Missions:  \ The game featured a set of recurrent game plays, playful physical interventions that could be freely interacted with between 8am and 10pm. These were complemented by small online tasks, such as answering questions, which each player could complete once a week. Additional weekly tangible Missions were conceived by game masters, civil servants with local knowledge and existing local networks with potential players. These missions were chosen to balance between entertainment value, team dynamics and benefit for the neighborhood (PER, REL, EMP), aimed to stimulate community action.  \  \ - Clarified the placement of the Trees: \ They were placed on a central square in the neighborhoods, considering the pedestrian safety norms.  \  \ - Added data on city and neighbourhoods:  \ In 2012, the city had a total of 247.941 inhabitants. T1: 7286 residents, 1040 of ethnic minority and 1461 older than 70. T2: 6958 residents, 899 of ethnic minority and 854 older than 70.  \  \ - Added the potential of users valuing their game additions as their own: \ Potentially, players themselves could design and build their own components and extend the game infrastructure. Valuing game modules as their own could generate very own dynamics. However, it remains a question what the importance is of a binding visual and conceptual metaphor (e.g. the reference to nature in ZWERM), which might be needed for players to perceive a networked project as a unified game.

Including info about the editorial team, payment for the journalists, timings of different stages, been more precise about the meetings that journalists attended and emphasised the close working relationship and editorial policy between the two.  \  \ -	Changed the ending of the Wayfinder section to reflect a little more on the failure/success of this design. \  \ -	Each analysis sub-section has been tweaked to include discussion of how that particular property might be applicable to local innovation. This has included re-working the first sub-section to be about the responsiveness and reflexivity of the process. \  \ -	Extensively reworked the conclusion to more succinctly summarise the contributions, benefits of the process and next steps in realising true local innovation. \  \ -	Added relevant reference to sustainability in community journalism. \  \ -	Adjusted language around â€˜utilisingâ€™ journalists (but not to utilising the method, which is subtly different). \  \ -	We looked closely at R5â€™s suggestion of cutting down the case studies in favour of a much more detailed method section. However, from our perspective, the design and deployment of these prototypes was the meat of the project. What we want to avoid is being overly prescriptive with how this process should be implemented: our project was complex and fluid and would naturally vary dramatically between different communities and contexts. Instead, we aimed to give concrete examples of how we utilised the journalism in a design process, that others might adapt.",,Nick Taylor,David Frohlich,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:14,pn581,A,"Always Somewhere, Never There: Using Critical Design to Understand Database Interactions",Melanie,Feinberg,feinberg@ischool.utexas.edu,pn0581-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Melanie Feinberg, Daniel Carter, Julia Bullard","feinberg@ischool.utexas.edu, carter.daniel.w@gmail.com, julia.a.bullard@gmail.com",22148,Melanie,,Feinberg,feinberg@ischool.utexas.edu,Information School,The University of Texas at Austin,Austin,Texas,United States,,,,,,37292,Daniel,,Carter,carter.daniel.w@gmail.com,Information School,The University of Texas at Austin,Austin,Texas,United States,,,,,,37293,Julia,,Bullard,julia.a.bullard@gmail.com,Information School,The University of Texas at Austin,Austin,Texas,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Structured databases achieve effective searching and sorting by enacting sharply delineated category boundaries around their contents. While this enables precise retrieval, it also distorts identities that exist between category lines. A choice between Single and Married, for example, blurs distinctions within the Single group: single, perhaps, merely because same-sex marriage is not legal in oneâ€™s locality. Sociologists Susan Leigh Star and Geoffrey Bowker describe such residual states as inevitable byproducts of information systems. To minimize residuality, traditional practice for descriptive metadata seeks to demarcate clear and objective classes. In this study, we use critical design to question this position by creating information collections that foreground the residual, instead of diminishing it. We then interrogate our design experiments with solicited critical responses from invited experts and student designers. Inspired by the anthropologist Tim Ingold, we argue that our experiments illuminate a form of interacting with databases characterized by notions of wayfaring, or inhabiting a space, as opposed to notions of transport, or reaching a known destination. We suggest that the form of coherence that shapes a wayfaring database is enacted through its flow, or fluid integration between structure and content.",Paper,Melanie Feinberg,feinberg@ischool.utexas.edu,"1.

This forces users to rest their palms elsewhere or hover above the screen, resulting in ergonomic and usability problems. We present a probabilistic touch filtering approach that uses the temporal evolution of touch contacts to reject palms.

To construct a pattern library, we observed human interactions across different scenarios and identified seven patterns, such as question-answer pairs. We then designed and implemented  Interaction Blocks, a visual authoring environment that enabled prototyping of robot interactions using these patterns.

Given the important role that social network sites play in online bereavement practices, we conducted a series of in-depth qualitative interviews to explore issues around inheritance and post-mortem data management of Facebook accounts. We found that participants focused less on ownership of the data, and instead on the duties and potential conflicts associated with maintaining an account post-mortem. Subsequently, we argue for â€œstewardshipâ€ù as an alternative to inheritance for framing post-mortem data management practices. Analysis of post-mortem data management activities highlights how stewards are accountable and responsible to the deceased and various survivors. However, weighing competing responsibilities is complicated by varied relationships with disparate survivors, as well as the inability to consult with the deceased. Based on our findings, we claim that post-mortem solutions need to account for the needs of stewards in addition to those of the deceased and survivors. We suggest that a model of stewardship better accounts for the interpersonal responsibilities that accompany online data than inheritance alone.",Paper,Jed Brubaker,jed.brubaker@uci.edu,"1.

Text throughout the document has been clarified, in particular the conclusion, to better frame our paper.  \ 2.	We specifically note that this paper does not contribute specific design recommendations, and that this should be done in future research. \ 3.	Following R2, we detailed some of the implications of not addressing the needs of stewards â€“ specifically the challenging position of having to mediate conflicting needs, and the problems this may present for their own mourning. \  \ Methods: \ 1.	We provided the gender breakdown of participants (R2). \ 2.	We explained that remote participants were sent a packet of sketches and were instructed to turn to specific pages during the interview (R2).  \ 3.	We clarified that while the three interviewing authors engaged in the open-coding of the interviews, all authors were involved in the synthesizing analysis that resulted in the final categories (R2). \  \ Related work: \ 1.	The related work identified by R3 was incorporated. \ 2.	In response to R5, more detailed age information was provided about our participants [age 20-50 (M=30.9; SD=10)]. \  \ Legal Issues: \ 1.	In response to R3, we added text to the related work explaining that while legal and policy issues around post-mortem data are evolving, the current study reflects the perspective of would-be-inheritors and demonstrates that inheritance may not be the most appropriate model when designing future services or solutions. \  \ Findings: \ 1.	At times the number of participants is only implied â€“ often with the term â€œmanyâ€ù (R2). We clarified this language throughout the findings with more specific numbers where appropriate.  \  \ Finally, we corrected typos mentioned by the reviewers throughout, along with generally tightening the language in order to make space for the new content. \ ",,Jed Brubaker,Lynn Dombrowski,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:10,pn601,A,Kinect-taped Communication: Using Motion Sensing to Study Gesture Use and Similarity in Face-to-Face and Computer-Mediated Brainstorming,Hao-Chuan,Wang,haochuan@cs.nthu.edu.tw,pn0601-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Hao-Chuan Wang, Chien-Tung Lai","haochuan@cs.nthu.edu.tw, s101062638@m101.nthu.edu.tw",27772,Hao-Chuan,,Wang,haochuan@cs.nthu.edu.tw,,National Tsing Hua University,HsinChu,,Taiwan,,,,,,37392,Chien-Tung,,Lai,s101062638@m101.nthu.edu.tw,,National Tsing Hua University,HsinChu,,Taiwan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"One key difference between face-to-face (F2F) communication and computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the availability of visual cues.

We conducted a field study of the most prominent of these, timebanking; a system in which â€˜time dollarsâ€™ are earned and spent by people providing services for and receiving them from each other. Our study exposed problems with the very metaphor of banking itself, which deter participation. In this paper we discuss how these problems can be tackled with user experience design for systems supporting timebanking. Our design ideas emphasize the personal and social benefits of participation, and avoid such unappealing concepts as debt and neediness that the timebanking metaphor falls afoul of.",Paper,Victoria Bellotti,bellotti@parc.com,"1.

Generally, animators create animations with standardized digital authoring software. However, the results tend to lack the individualism or atmosphere of physical media. In contrast, illustrators have skills in painting physical media but have limited experience in animation. To incorporate their skills, we present a workflow that integrates the offline painting and digital animation creation processes in a labor-saving manner. First, a user makes a rough sketch of the visual elements and defines their movements using our digital authoring software with a sketch interface. Then these images are exported to printed pages, and users can paint using offline physical media. Finally, the work is scanned and imported back into the digital content, forming a composite animation that combines digital and physical media. We present an implementation of this system to demonstrate its workflow. We also discuss the advantages of using physical media in digital animations through design evaluations.",Paper,Makoto Nakajima,unycone@gmail.com,"1. Amati, C., and Brostow, G. J.

We revised our paper to satisfy requests from reviewers as much as possible.  \  \ We describe summary of changes for the revision here. Note that changes in text are highlighted with color of red, and we are planning to use English-proof service (Native check) for the final version of the paper.  \  \ First, we address most important issue from R4 (primary) in the Post-PC meeting comment.  \  \ 1. We reframed the paper to make our motivation clear. Specifically, our target user group is the illustrator and not animator. \ As we said in the rebuttal, we revised ""Introduction"" and â€œAbstractâ€ù session to make our motivation clear what is our scope. In addition, we replaced ambiguous word ""artist"" to ""illustrator"" to make the story consistent.  \  \ 2. We restructured ""finding/analysis"" section around the key concepts rather than phases. \ We entirely re-organized â€œDiscussionâ€ù section to make the discussion more focused on the workflow, not the system. Basically, we use same participantsâ€™ comments with the previous version. But, the discussions are revised to focused on the Workflow.   \  \ 3. We described our user study as a softer representation such as ""Design Evaluation"". \ As R6 suggested, we change the title of the section â€œDesign Evaluationâ€ù and reframed the document consistently. \  \ Second, we also revised the paper based on plans that we proposed in the rebuttal and comments from reviewers. \  \  \ * We added details about our user study (what were pre- and post-questionnaires). \ * We added references to analyze animation workflows in ""Modern Workflow"". (Citation #7, #32, #33) \ * We added implementation details how to export an animation to external software. \ * We added ""Comparing Workflows"" in ""Discussion"" to discuss the workflow itself. \ * We removed a topic ""our system is easy to learn"" because it wasn't our main scope. \ * In order to make rooms to include more discussions and descriptions, we removed â€œFuture workâ€ù section. \ * We removed redundant contents, such as comments for sketching interface, from ""USER FEEDBACK AND ANALYSIS"".  \ * We added clearer descriptions how much our workflow reduces labors to ""General Impression to the Workflow.â€ù \ * We added claims to insist that current shortcomings are good guidance for future improvement to ""Limitation"". \ * We corrected typos. \  \ Again, thank you very much for your hard work to our paper. We are, of course, available to revise the paper again with your additional comment, and waiting for your feedback.  \ ",,Makoto Nakajima,Daisuke Sakamoto,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:58,pn621,A,"In-Your-Face, Yet Unseen?

This ensures that critical information (e.g. warnings) is continuously visible and can, in principle, be perceived as quickly as possible. We examined this strategy with a physically and visually distracted driver. We ran two consecutive studies in a driving simulator, comparing different warning visualizations in a head-up display (HUD) and a HMD. In an initial study, we found no significant effects of warning type or display technology on the reaction times. In a second study, after modifying our visualization to include a visual reference marker, we found that with only this minor change, reaction times were significantly lower in the HMD when compared to the HUD. Our insights can help others design better head-stabilized notifications.  ",Note,Felix Lauber,felix.lauber@ifi.lmu.de,"1. Baber, C., Knight, J., Haniff, D. and Cooper, L.

It has generally been assumed that for this latter case people must engage in a deeper semantic evaluation of items during the search process. This idea is central to Information Foraging theory. But do people actually spend longer assessing items when engaged in a semantically demanding search task? We investigate this by having participants locate target items in 16-item menus. Participants were either told exactly what to look for (known-item search) or they were told the category that the target belonged to (semantic search). Participants were faster and more accurate at known-item searches. Eye-movement data show that this was because participants were more likely to skip over items when performing known-item searches. Contrary to expectation, we found limited empirical evidence to support the idea that deeper semantic evaluations of items lead to longer gaze durations (this occurred only when items were arranged very close together). This finding is important because it reveals how people adopt different eye gaze strategies depending on the kind of search activity they are engaged in.",Note,Duncan Brumby,Brumby@cs.ucl.ac.uk,"1.

There are clearly design features that could greatly improve accuracy in entering numbers but the context of the task could also play an important role. In particular, the emotional state of a person is known to strongly influence their response to a difficult situation and hence the errors that they make. In this paper, we consider the impact of the emotional state of the user on the accuracy with which people enter numbers. Our experiment shows that participants who are in a more positive emotional state are more accurate. The effect is small but could be very important when considering the potentially highly-charged emotional contexts where many healthcare devices are used. \ ",Note,Paul Cairns,paul.cairns@york.ac.uk,"1.

We have done so in the Design section on p2. \  \ R5 also asked that we made the changes stated in our rebuttal. These are detailed as follows. \  \ We needed to make it clear that this study lacked ecological validity because it is a test of the principle that affective state influences number entry error. We have amended the end of the introduction, the aim of the experiment and the conclusions to reflect this emphasis. \  \ There were several issues raised around ecological validity including the use of IAPS, the use of long numbers, the use of a number pad and not other types of interface, the use of touchscreens and the control of typing style to one-finger. The experimental aim now acknowledges that such manipulations affect ecological validity and defers the details to the Discussion section. We noted in the Procedure that one-finger typing was required to remove variability. In the Discussion, we briefly outlined all of the issues and noted our reasons for these choices. We removed discussion of more complex tasks around games and what was reference [11] that supported it. This seemed too specific and narrow given the broader concerns raised by reviewers and also we were restricted in space. Instead we asserted again the in principle nature of the reported work and that these failings would need to be addressed in future work. \  \ There were various issues around the display. We have noted in the Figure that the arrow keys are unused in this study and also asserted that the C key did not cause confusion in terms of commit or clear based on our data. \  \ The ANOVAs were re-done non-parametrically using Mann-Whitney tests (not Wilcoxon as incorrectly stated in the rebuttal) and the boxplot axes were labelled as required by R3. \  \ We have indicated in the Discussion further work is needed to address the issues of ecological validity and that we hope to work with nurses as participants in the near future.

Despite this evolution, the interaction model for how incoming calls are handled has barely changed. Current-generation smartphones still use abrupt full-screen notifications to alert users to incoming calls, demanding a decision to either accept or decline the call. These full-screen notifications forcibly interrupt whatever activity the user was already engaged in. This might be undesirable when the userâ€™s primary task was more important than the incoming call. This paper explores the design space for how smartphones can alert users to incoming calls. We consider designs that allow users to postpone calls and also to multiplex by way of a smaller partial-screen notification. These design alternatives were evaluated in both a small-scale controlled lab study as well as a large-scale naturalistic in-the-wild study. Results show that a multiplex design solution works best because it allows people to continue working on their primary task while being made aware that there is a caller on the line. The contribution of this work is an enhanced interaction design for handling phone calls, and an understanding of how people use it for handling incoming calls.

This paper describes experiments to assess machine learning classification algorithms on their ability to automatically identify elevated cognitive workload levels in drivers, leading towards the development of robust tools for automobile user interface evaluation. We look at using both driver performance as well as physiological data. These measures can be collected in real-time and do not interfere with the primary task of driving the vehicle. We report classification accuracies of up to 90% for detecting elevated levels of cognitive load, and show that the inclusion of physiological data leads to higher classification accuracy than vehicle sensor data evaluated alone. Finally, we show results suggesting that models can be built to classify cognitive load across individuals, instead of building individual models for each per-son. By collecting data from drivers in two large field studies on the highway (20 drivers and 99 drivers), this work extends prior work and demonstrates feasibility and potential of such measures for HCI research in vehicles.",Paper,Erin Solovey,erin.t.solovey@drexel.edu," \ WARNING: Reference 27 starts with a non-alphanumeric character.

Samples are chosen by the system for low and high values of each latent factor considered. The method positions the user in the latent factor space with few interaction steps, and finally selects items near the user position as recommendations. \  \ In a user study, we compare the system with three alternative approaches including manual search and automatic recommending. The results show significant advantages of our approach over the three competing alternatives in 15 out of 24 possible parameter comparisons, in particular with respect to item fit, interaction effort and user control.

It combines the advantages of algorithmic Collaborative Filtering techniques with the benefits of user-controlled, interactive exploration.","As already announced in our rebuttal, we have improved the final version of our paper in accordance with the valuable comments provided by the reviewers. In detail, we made the following changes: \  \ - Since R1 suggested to compare our work with [Zhao et al., 2013], we included this reference in the related work section â€œAutomatic and Interactive Recommender Systemsâ€ù (paragraph 3) and describe its main contribution. \  \ - Due to R2's concerns regarding the benefit of including the popularity-based method in the user study, we have now made the purpose and benefit of including the simple, popularity-based approach as a baseline more explicit (section on evaluation has been modified). We also address the issue of comparing our method with other interactive approaches in the concluding section by discussing their need for additional data, as well as our related plans left for future work. \  \ - According to R2's comments, we rewrote the paragraph below Table 2 to make it more readable. Also, the layout of Table 2 has been improved to make it more perspicuous. In addition, we now introduce the purpose of each table in the preceding paragraph. \  \ - In response to R2, we added some clarifying statements about the need for additional data with respect to the Popularity criterion used in the respective subsection â€œSelection of Appropriate Representativesâ€ù. \  \ - Based on R3's request to see our method applied in other domains, we state in the concluding section that we plan to perform evaluations in other application domains in follow-up studies. Additionally, we now more explicitly motivate our use of the MovieLens dataset which is in widespread use as a reference dataset for evaluating recommender systems (in the â€œSettingâ€ù subsection of the Evaluation section), and point out the generally high level of domain independence of CF-algorithms, which is the main reason why we believe our approach to be well transferable to other domains (in the section â€œConclusions and Outlookâ€ù). \  \ - We extended our concluding section to respond to R3's request for additional timing data explaining in more detail why we concentrated on subjective measurements in this comparative study. We also point out that efficiency-related aspects will be addressed more extensively in future in-depth studies. \  \ - Finally, we have made some minor changes with regard to wording and images in order to improve page layout and print quality.",,Benedikt Loepp,Juergen Ziegler,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 17:12,pn653,A,Together Alone: Motivations for Live-Tweeting a Television Series,,,,pn0653-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Steven Schirra, Huan Sun, Frank Bentley","schirra@mit.edu, sunhuan@mit.edu, bentley79@gmail.com",34585,Steven,,Schirra,schirra@mit.edu,Comparative Media Studies,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,Massachusetts,United States,,,,,,29237,Huan,,Sun,sunhuan@mit.edu,Comparative Media Studies,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,MA,United States,,,,,,6239,Frank,,Bentley,bentley79@gmail.com,Comparative Media Studies,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,Massachusetts,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper, we explore motivations for live-tweeting across a season of a television show.

Semi-structured interviews with 11 diverse live-tweeters revealed that the decision to live-tweet is dependent upon a variety of personal considerations and social conventions forming around this emerging TV viewing practice. This includes the desire to feel connected to a larger community that is interested in the show. Participants actively sought to protect the user experience of others by following good live-tweeting â€œetiquette,â€ù including limiting their number of posts and censoring content that might spoil the show for others.

We were also interested in how people balanced watching the show and participating on Twitter as well as understanding browsing versus posting behaviors.â€ù \  \ Added this sentence to the discussion on methods: â€œEach theme discussed below has support from multiple diverse participants.â€ù \  \ Added discussion of relation of work the Turkleâ€™s Alone Together: â€œIn her book â€œAlone Together,â€ù Turkle [17] argues that communication on SNS provides hollow, inauthentic communication that distracts from in-person interactions. However, in our study, we observed Twitter having the opposite effect, particularly in contexts where participantsâ€™ spouses or housemates did not have an interest in the show. Live-tweeting helped strengthen existing friendships or form new ones while conversing about the television content, even though participants were physically alone.â€ù \  \ Added to discussion: However most of the existing research has focused on what can be learned from the tweets themselves.  Our research goes beyond this work to explore what cannot be found in the content itself through in-depth interviews about current practices. \ ",,Steven Schirra,Huan Sun,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:44,pn654,A,"Bigger is not always better: Display Size, Performance, and Task Load during Peephole Map Navigation",Roman,RÃ_dle,Roman.Raedle@uni-konstanz.de,pn0654-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Roman RÃ_dle, Hans-Christian Jetter, Jens MÃ_ller, Harald Reiterer","Roman.Raedle@uni-konstanz.de, h.jetter@ucl.ac.uk, jens.mueller@uni-konstanz.de, harald.reiterer@uni-konstanz.de",24374,Roman,,RÃ_dle,Roman.Raedle@uni-konstanz.de,Human-Computer Interaction Group,University of Konstanz,Konstanz,,Germany,,,,,,14095,Hans-Christian,,Jetter,h.jetter@ucl.ac.uk,Intel ICRI Cities,University College London,London,,United Kingdom,,,,,,36680,Jens,,MÃ_ller,jens.mueller@uni-konstanz.de,Human-Computer Interaction Group,University,Konstanz,,Germany,,,,,,10143,Harald,,Reiterer,harald.reiterer@uni-konstanz.de,Human-Computer Interaction Group,University,Konstanz,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dynamic peephole navigation is an increasingly popular technique for navigating large information spaces such as maps.

Readers familiar with our methods should not be confused, but hopefully it will be much clearer now to all readers that broad generalizability is not the goal.

In this paper, we focus on the problems programmers face in navigating large code bases, and propose a novel code editor, Patchworks, that addresses the problems. In particular, Patchworks leverages two new interface idioms--the patch grid and the ribbon--to help programmers navigate more quickly, make fewer navigation errors, and spend less time arranging their code. To validate Patchworks, we conducted a user study that compared Patchworks to two existing code editors: the traditional file-based editor, Eclipse, and the newer canvas-based editor, Code Bubbles. Our results showed (1) that programmers using Patchworks were able to navigate significantly faster than with Eclipse (and comparably with Code Bubbles), (2) that programmers using Patchworks made significantly fewer navigation errors than with Code Bubbles or Eclipse, and (3) that programmers using Patchworks spent significantly less time arranging their code than with Code Bubbles (and comparably with Eclipse).",Paper,Austin Z.

Although useful in most environments, audio notifications are ineffective in certain situations, especially against particular auditory backgrounds or when the user is distracted. Several studies have used behavioral performance to evaluate audio notifications, but these studies failed to achieve consistent results due to factors including user subjectivity and environmental differences; thus, a new method and more objective indicators are necessary. In this study, we propose an approach based on electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate audio notifications by measuring users' auditory perceptual responses (mismatch negativity) and attention shifting (P3a). We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the usability testing of audio notifications in realistic scenarios, such as users performing a major task amid ambient noises.

We have revised our paper based on your comments and asked a native speaker to proofread our paper. The followings are the summary of changes: \  \ (1) Based on R1â€™s comments, we have corrected the typos, grammar errors, and reference formats and asked a native speaker to carefully proofread all parts of our manuscript, especially the sections of Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. We also briefly introduced PAIRS game in Experiment 2 and used a larger font-size in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4. \  \ (2) As suggested by R4 on connecting our work with the BCI community, we introduced the paper by Zander and Kothe in the subsection, â€œRelated Work and Background: Brain Sensing for Evaluatingâ€ù. \  \ (3) As suggested by R1 and R4 on clarifying the statistical methods, we described the methods of multiple comparison and correction adopted in this work in the last paragraph of the section, â€œEEG Recording and Data Analysisâ€ù. We also clarified that our data did not violate the assumption of sphericity in Experiments 1 and 2. \  \ (4) Due to the page length limit, we removed six references: Knight et al. 1998; NÂ¨aÂ¨atÂ¨anen et al. 1999; Churchland et al. 1988; Paavilainen et al. 2001; Berti et al. 2004; McGee et al. 1997. As these papers have similar findings to other cited papers: Escera et al. 2000; NÂ¨aÂ¨atÂ¨anen et al. 2007, we just retain the papers published recently in the revised version.  \  \ (5) On Page 8, we changed the subsection title â€œWhatâ€™s Beyond?â€ù to â€œComparison to Previous Studiesâ€ù for better describing the theme of the subsection. \  \ (6) We modified the Figure 1 to make it more straightforward. \  \ Thank you again for all your help on improving our paper.

Analyzing online personal ads from Craigslist, we found a substantial increase in SHR language, from ~23% in 1988 to over 53% today, echoing continuing concern about rising HIV rates. We argue that SHR language in Craigslist ads can be used as a sensor to provide insight into HIV epidemiology as well as discourse among particular communities. We show a positive significant relationship between prevalence rate of HIV in an adâ€™s location and use of SHR language in that location. Analysis highlights the opportunity for SHR information found in Craigslist personal ads to serve as a data source for HIV prevention research. More broadly, we argue for mining large-scale user-generated content to inform HCI design of health and other systems, and explore use of such data to examine temporal changes in language to facilitate improved user-interface design.",Paper,Oliver L.

We have revised the paper to address reviewer concerns. Changes are outlined below: \  \  \ IMPLICATIONS FOR HCI \ We have brought HCI implications to the forefront of the paper and re-worked the paper to speak to an HCI audience, emphasizing: \  \ 1.	This work is an example of mining user-generated content for secondary purposes (AC). Similar methods and techniques could be used in other domains (e.g., urban or civic informatics). \ 2.	To properly design large-scale health data systems (R1), HCI research must be conducted on the information architecture of such data and its use as a sensor. \ 3.	Codifying large-scale data from Craigslist highlights issues around the timescale of data as a sensor, particularly given evolving language (R2). \  \ We have added content about the evolution of personal ad content over time, noting how differences in SHR language between 1980s personal ads and current Craigslist ads highlight the constant evolution of SHR language (R2). \  \ Additionally, we have added an in-depth discussion section (R3), highlighting implications for design and HCI.  \  \  \ SEXUAL HEALTH DICTIONARY \ We clarified that we intentionally excluded drug related terms to focus the scope of our paper on sexual health, replicate Davidsonâ€™s methods, and compare current levels of SHR language to the 1980s (R2).  \   \ We have corrected the inaccurate description of our methods and clarified that 500 ads in total were coded, 125 by all 4 coders for inter-rater reliability (AC).  \  \  \ RELATED WORK \ We have included the references provided by R1 and R2, and agree that they complement the paper. Thank you for bringing these additional references to our attention! We revised the related work section to focus more on addressing how our research questions relate to the existing literature and fill gaps in HCI research (R3). \  \  \ LIMITATIONS \ We have addressed R5â€™s suggestion to include more information about potential limitations of our research. Specifically, we have added content describing the extent to which Craigslist is representative of the MSM community (AC, R5), address the potential issue of people misrepresenting their HIV status on Craigslist (AC), and discuss the presence of irrelevant ads in our dataset (AC). \  \  \ OTHER CONCERNS \ Additionally, we have addressed the following: \ â€¢	We use less strong language regarding the relationship between HIV concern and prevalence (R1). \ â€¢	We define MSM in the paper body (R3). \ â€¢	We revisited our age group distinctions (R3), clarified Table 4, and mention that public health campaigns in the 90s may have influenced the uniqueness of the 32-37 age group (R3). \ â€¢	We proofread thoroughly to remove repetition (R3). \ ",,Oliver Haimson,Jed Brubaker,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:27,pn683,A,A Systematic Review of Quantitative Studies on the Enjoyment of Digital Entertainment Games,Elisa,Mekler,elisa.mekler@unibas.ch,pn0683-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Elisa D.

We conducted a systematic review of 87 quantitative studies, analyzing different operationalizations and measures of game enjoyment, its determinants, and how these were related to other components of PX, such as flow, presence and immersion. Results suggest that game enjoyment describes the positive cognitive and affective appraisal of the game experience, and may in part be associated with the support of player needs and values. Further, we outline that enjoyment is distinct from flow in that it may occur independently of challenge and cognitive involvement, and argue that enjoyment may be understood as the valence of the player experience.

Data consists of aim of the study, measures, results, measuring times, study designs, sample, game genre, duration of gameplay, and if provided, definition of enjoyment","We conducted a systematic review of 87 quantitative studies, comparing different measures of game enjoyment, as well as how they relate to other player experience components, such as flow.","1.  In the introduction section, we clarify the scope of the paper by highlighting the problem of inconsistent measures in PX research, due to the different conceptualizations and subsequent operationalizations of game enjoyment, hence our focus on quantitative studies. As suggested by R2, we also changed the title and abstract to reflect the reviewâ€™s focus on quantitative studies and digital entertainment games. Consequently, we have revised parts of the discussion and adapted the wording throughout the paper accordingly. \  \ 2. We considerably shortened the method section describing the QUOROM procedure. The current version focuses mostly on the selection criteria. More importantly, we realize that the wording concerning the exclusion of serious games and exergames was rather clumsy in the original version. We agree with AC1 and AC3 that these types of games are and should be designed with enjoyment in mind, and acknowledge this in the paper. Rather, we chose to focus on digital entertainment games, because usually their sole â€œintendedâ€ù goal is enjoyment. As for AR and pervasive games, we could not include them for the sake of manageability and we think it is important to clearly state which types of games were included in the review and which were not. However, we now explicitly list this as a limitation of our review and encourage further research to examine whether our findings extend to serious games, exergames and pervasive games. \  \ 3. The results section was overhauled for improved clarity and readability (e.g., enlarging Table 1). We checked and corrected inconsistencies, and removed any redundancies in the text that were already covered in the tables. Moreover, we clarify what we mean by objective and subjective measures of enjoyment. Lastly, we chose to display only absolute numbers. \  \ 4. The discussion has been revised. In particular, the section on the â€œpositive disposition towards oneselfâ€ù has been completely rewritten. Instead, we elaborate upon the fact that several of the reviewed studies found a relation between need satisfaction and game enjoyment, and that there were some indications that enjoyment is negatively correlated with feelings of guilt. Moreover, we expand upon promising directions for future research, in particular concerning the valence and intensity of the player experience. \  \ 5. Finally, we adjusted Figure 1 to more clearly highlight that flow is also characterized by enjoyment, as suggested by R1. \  \ 6. A supplementary PDF table containing the data collected for all 87 studies is included in the auxiliary materials. \ ",games,Elisa Mekler,Julia Bopp,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:31,pn686,A,Don't Forget Your Pill!

We report the findings of a functionality review of 229 medication reminder apps and a thematic analysis of their 1,012 user reviews. Our research highlights the gap between the theory and practice: while the literature shows that many medication regimens are habitual in nature and the presence of daily routines supports remembering, existing apps rely on timer-based reminders. To address this disparity, we present design requirements for building medication reminders that support the routine aspect of medication-taking and its individual nature, and demonstrate how they could be implemented to move from passive alerts to a smarter memory and routine assistant.",Paper,Katarzyna Stawarz,katarzyna.stawarz.10@ucl.ac.uk,"1.

We have also looked at the detailed suggestions/problems and corrected these. \  \ This said, we have created a better frame for the paper and a stronger focus. In the next we will go through the different issues raised by the reviewers: \  \ Framing \ As suggested by review 1 we have changed the introduction from a presentation of what the persona method is to an introduction of what we did, why another persona study is needed and what we contribute with. \ In this paper we compare our study to studies that have looked at practice and practitioners.  \  \ Related work \ In the related work section we have tightened how the research in the paper differentiate from the related works and the learning points provided from this current research. \  \ The findings in the literature are collected in sections which makes it easier to understand and, later, to compare the findings from the current study to the literature. Furthermore some findings in the literature on practice are compared to common recommendations to describe how they deviate. \  \ Participants \ As suggested we have created a table of companies and interviewees that participated the table covers: company size and type, type of product, years of personas use, job role of interviewee, and personas examples provided. Instead of adding more to the table, as suggested, we have added an additional table that gives an overview of the findings. \  \ Methodology \ The section on methodology has been completely rewritten to include a section on qualitative studies and how this study relates to the paradigm of qualitative studies. \  \ Review 2 writes â€œLack of test measurement as evidence to validate the findings of the study. The authors need to work out this issue.â€ù  \ Unfortunately Review 2 does not seem to understanding that this study is qualitative in its essence and test measurement, as evidence does not apply to qualitative studies that have other demands to validity such as the ability to follow the arguments and comparing the results to literature. \  \ Findings  \ As mentioned we have created a table of findings that cover persona development, persona creation, personas as a UX method, personas in use and satisfaction with personas.  \ The table provided a structure and helped us prioritise the sections. This made us rewrite most of the section and has helped us to guide the writing in order to make the findings more clear and the text more concise.  \ Persona descriptions \ Unfortunately the persona descriptions are all confidential so we cannot provide any examples or illustrations.  \ We have not changed anything here, but Table 1 includes an overview of how many persona descriptions we have had access to. \ Discussion  \ As mentioned we have introduced what the paper contributes with right at the beginning of the paper. \  \ We have in the discussion taken point of departure in the findings from the existing literature and compare these to the findings in our study. In order to do so we have collected 6 key arguments from the literature that our study is compared to: personas are not used for design, designers do not refer to personas in their discussions, problems with persona descriptions, personas are not created entirely on data, personas are not created at the beginning of the design process, and benefits of the method. \  \ In order to make the text more explicit and clarify the findings we have removed all quotes. This provides an analytic level to the study instead of the story-telling that the reviewers would like to see more of. We find that it provides more meaning to give a common overview instead of reporting from single cases and this furthermore supports the uniqueness of capturing practice across disciplines and industries. \ ",,Lene Nielsen,Kira Storgaard Nielsen,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/14/14 11:44,pn691,A,What If We Ask A Different Question?: Social Inferences Create Product Ratings Faster,Eric,Gilbert,gilbert@cc.gatech.edu,pn0691-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,Eric Gilbert,gilbert@cc.gatech.edu,7571,Eric,,Gilbert,gilbert@cc.gatech.edu,School of Interactive Computing,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,Georgia,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Consumer product reviews are the backbone of commerce online. Most commonly, sites ask users for their personal opinions on a product or service. I conjecture, however, that this traditional method of eliciting reviews often invites idiosyncratic viewpoints. In this paper, I present a statistical study examining the differences between traditionally elicited product ratings (i.e., â€œHow do you rate this product?â€ù) and social inference ratings (i.e., â€œHow do you think other people will rate this product?â€ù). In 5 of 6 trials, I find that social inference ratings produce the same aggregate product rating as the one produced via traditionally elicited ratings. In all cases, however, social inferences yield less variance. This is significant because using social inference ratings 1) therefore converges on the true aggregate product rating faster, and 2) is a cheap design intervention on the part of existing sites.",Note,Eric Gilbert,gilbert@cc.gatech.edu,"1.

(which R2 & R3 note as novel) \ - This was addressed in the section labeled Socio-Economic Status: \ â€œPrevious work in HCI [e.g., 6, 9] has focused on designing for higher-income older adults. This preceding work emphasizes technologies to support a one-to-one (caregiver-to-older adult) relationship. The low-SES older adults in our study had a much richer ecosystem of family members, service providers and peersâ€_â€ù \ - We agree with R2, R3 and R4 in that the primary novelty of contribution of our work is designing for low-income older adults, whereas previous work in HCI (e.g., Forlizzi et al; Mynatt et al) has focused on designing for higher-income older adults. \  \ The reviewer R4 commented - â€œAuthors have failed to draw out clear and actionable information about what is different about designing for this group, as opposed to adults of higher ES.â€ù  \ - Based on the contextual observations conducted on eight low-income older adults we found that low SES do not have a single informal caregiver and rely on peer groups for their needs. This can be found in section labeled Socio-Economic Status: \ â€œP1: â€œWhen I first moved in, the guy around the corner used to take me to stores and stuff like that, and cash my check. Every time Iâ€™m going to go to the grocery store I get him to go and take me.â€ù \ â€œIn another population (asthma patients), Jeong et al. found that that there is a trend of low-income populations relying more heavily on peers, and in particular a variety of informal caregivers [7].â€ù  \ - This reliance on peer-to-peer interaction drove the design process of the Check-In.  \  \ The reviewer R3 commented - â€œPaper says very little about why lower SES older adults rely more on peer-to-peer interactionâ€ù  \ - This was addressed in the section labeled Checking-In: Check-In Tree: \  â€œOlder adults often devise a check-in system in which they can indicate to a neighbor that they have gotten up in the morning (e.g., turn on/off the porch light) and the neighbor agrees to call if they are not up by a certain time [10]â€_.â€ù \  \ The reviewer  R4 commented â€“ â€œSituating this work more clearly in the literature, and providing clear evidence for how the design was derived for.â€ù \ - We agree, and would like to thank the reviewers (R4, R1, R5) for pointing us to Forlizzi et al., Jeong et al., Rubinstein et al., Rowles et al., and Ylirisku et al. \ - Forlizzi et al. was referenced in the section labeled Evolution of Tree Form \ - Jeong et al. was referenced in the section labeled Socio-Economic Status \ - Rubinstein et al. was referenced in the section labeled Socio-Economic Status \ - Rowles et al. was referenced in the section labeled Checking In: Check In Tree \ - Ylirisku et al. was referenced in the section labeled Evolution of Tree Form \  \ The reviewer R1 commented â€“ â€œThe choice to use a manual switch to try and engage elders seems to discount a number of health issues that come with becoming an elder.â€ù  \ - We agree with R1 that a manual button may have disadvantages, and debated this point extensively during the design process. Ultimately, we chose the manual button to engage the older adult with the tree; this button can easily be replaced with an automatic motion-sensor check-in. \ - This can be found in the discussion: \ â€œAnother important design decision related to mobility was to design all three prototypes to blend in to a homeâ€™s dÃ©cor so that older adults will place them in commonly occupied spaces, such as a living roomâ€_we have designed the tree such that the button interaction can easily be replaced with a motion sensor to automatically â€˜check-inâ€™ an older adult if we find use is low or burdensome.â€ù  \  \ The reviewer R2 commented - â€œIt would be interesting to include quotes to help support the findings.â€ù \ - We agree with R2 that having quotes would help support our findings. We included one quote from the contextual observation we held with older adults. This can be found in the section labeled Socio-Economic Status \ â€œP1: â€˜When I first moved in, the guy around the corner used to take me to stores and stuff like that, and cash my check. Every time Iâ€™m going to go to the grocery store I get him to go and take me.â€™â€ù \  \ The reviewer R4 commented â€“ â€œMinimize drastically the space spent on previously published systems and studies for half of the paper. Use the remaining space to maximize description of your contribution and the new knowledge.â€ù \ - We significantly reduced the sections pertaining to the previous systems (ambient plant and presence clock). In the original submission it was titled â€œRemote Presenceâ€ù however it was renamed to the section titled Checking On: Ambient Plant & Presence Clock.   \  \ - There were other miscellaneous edits made so that we could fit it all to the page limit.",,Ingrid Arreola,Kelly Caine,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:08,pn714,A,Current and Future Mobile and Wearable Device  Use by People With Visual Impairments,Leah,Findlater,leahkf@umd.edu,pn0714-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Hanlu Ye, Meethu Malu, Uran Oh, Leah Findlater","hye@wellesley.edu, meethu24@gmail.com, uranoh@cs.umd.edu, leahkf@umd.edu",38414,Hanlu,,Ye,hye@wellesley.edu,Computer Science Department,Wellesley College,Wellesley,Massachusetts,United States,,,,,,22431,Meethu,,Malu,meethu24@gmail.com,Department of Computer Science,University of Maryland,College Park,Maryland,United States,,,,,,29638,Uran,,Oh,uranoh@cs.umd.edu,Department of Computer Science,University of Maryland,College Park,Maryland,United States,,,,,,3198,Leah,,Findlater,leahkf@umd.edu,College of Information Studies,University of Maryland,College Park,Maryland,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the increasing popularity of mainstream wearable devices, it is critical to assess the accessibility implications of such technologies. For people with visual impairments, who do not always need the visual display of a mobile phone, alternative means of eyes-free wearable interaction are particularly appealing. To explore the potential impacts of such technology, we conducted two studies. The first was an online survey that included 114 participants with visual impairments and 101 sighted participants; we compare the two groups in terms of current device use. The second was an interview and design probe study with 10 participants with visual impairments. Our findings expand on past work to characterize a range of trends in smartphone use and accessibility issues therein. Participants with visual impairments also responded positively to two eyes-free wearable device scenarios: a wristband or ring and a glasses-based device. Discussions on projected use of these devices suggest that small, easily accessible, and discreet wearable input could positively impact the ability of people with visual impairments to access information on the go and to participate in certain social interactions.",Paper,Leah Findlater,leahkf@umd.edu,"1.

The task requirements, managed by Fittsâ€™ index of difficulty (ID), i.e. the size and distance apart of the targets, were varied between tasks, and pupil responses to different task IDs were recorded. The results showed that pupil diameter can be employed as an indicator of task requirements in goal-directed movementsâ€”higher task difficulty evoked higher valley to peak pupil dilation, and the peak pupil dilation occurred after a longer delay.

Major revisions to the paper are highlighted (deleted text in red and added text in blue) and summarized here as follows. \ Experimental Design:  \ In responding to R3â€™s concern that remote eye-tracking also is invasive to the participant, we changed the sentence (Page 2, at the end of 3th paragraph of Related Work) â€œOne way to overcome the problem with intrusiveness is to apply remote sensors such as eye tracking.â€ù to â€œModern eye-tracking systems can monitor the eye movements remotely. Pupil size data are a by-product of virtually all psychophysical experiments which use eye tracking and are thus available without adding any further technology to the experiment.â€ù \ For the counterbalance problem (R1), we improved Fig. 2 caption (as also suggested by R3) to include: â€œthe pairs of target circles on the paper inside the training box showing on the screen as in Figure 1). One group of subjects executed bottom up from the easiest task to the hardest task and then back to the easiest task (shown in the upper panel); another group of subjects executed bottom up from hard to easy tasks and then back to the hardest task (lower panel).  A1 to A3 represent the distances between targets and W1 to W3 represent the sizes of the targets of ID1 to ID3.â€ù We also added that the ANOVA results to show no significant ordering effect (Page 4, at the end of Tasks and Procedure) â€œWe did not consider other ordering options like executing from middle difficulty to hardest to easiest, because the ANOVA results showed there was no significant difference in movement time between the two groups, and no interaction effect of ID and group order.â€ù \ Analysis:  \ To clarify the moment of tool-reach, we added a sentence to the end of subsection Identification of moments of tooltip leaving and arriving (Page 5) â€œThe moment of tool-reach detected by the algorithm is the moment that the tool quickly arrives at a position above (but not necessarily touching) the target circle.â€ù \ In responding to R1 and R2â€™s concern with the motivation of the 7s window, we added the sentences (Page 5, at the second paragraph of Pupil data processing and segment extraction) â€œThe 7-second window is motivated by considering the extra movement time (about 1s-2s) before the tool leaves in our study compared with others who noted pupil increases start 1.5s before the stimulus [20, 22, 23] and the pupil continuous to dilate afterwards to a peak value in a few seconds e.g. 3s-window in [22], 4s-window in [23], and 5s-window in [20].â€ù  \ Results: \ Page 5: We deleted the paragraph stating the mean pupil size for baselines were not significantly different, as we combined this paragraph to 13th paragraph to make the paper more concise.  \ â€œThe mean pupil size through a whole trial for all the valid trials is 4.1mm (Â±0.8mm). The mean pupil size at baseline was 3.9mm (Â±1.0mm) for Easy and 4.0mm (Â±1.0mm) for Middle and Hard IDs. There was no significant difference between three IDs in terms of mean pupil size in baselines of the moves in each ID.â€ù \ Regarding R1â€™s concerns about the 17 data points in Figs. 9 and 10, we added the following explanation in the text of the first paragraph in Descriptive analysis (Page 7): â€œFor clarity, error bars are drawn every 400ms rather than drawn for every time sample (at 50Hz).â€ù Also the text â€œthe data is averaged over all 808 valid movements of 69 trials from 12 subjectsâ€ù and â€œThe error bars for 1 std. dev. are drawn every 400ms.â€ù were added to the captions of Figs. 9 and 10. \ Regarding that R1 did not think that the figures illustrated a clear relationship between pupil dilation and difficulty, we expanded the data analysis on the valley to peak pupil dilation and the valley to peak pupil duration, and added four short paragraphs to enhance this evidence. \ (1)	A paragraph at the end of Descriptive analysis (Page 7).  â€œFurthermore, the increase of pupil size from the valley (between 3s and 4s in Fig. 10) to its peak correlates to IDs; the easy task (black curve) increased about 0.13mm (0.07mm at valley to 0.2mm at peak), whereas the middle task (pink curve) increased about 0.18mm (0.02 to 0.2mm). The hardest task (green) had the largest increase of about 0.27mm (-0.01 to 0.26mm). Also, the valley to peak duration can be observed to be different between IDs.â€ù  \ (2)	A paragraph to show the ANOVA results on the increase pupil size and duration from valley to peak in terms three IDs (Page 7, 6th paragraph in the section Statistical analysis). â€œANOVA shows there is significant difference in the pupil size increase from valley to peak between IDs (F(2,805) = 44.754, p < .001). Post Hoc test (Tukey HSD) shows that the mean increase of pupil size from valley to peak is significantly different (p < .001) between Easy (0.3Â±0.2mm), Middle (0.4Â±0.2mm), and Hard ID (0.5Â±0.2mm).â€ù  \ (3)	Another paragraph to show the duration of the pupil dilation from its valley to peak size between IDs is significant (P7, 7th paragraph in Statistical Analysis) â€œANOVA shows there is significant difference in the duration of the pupil dilation from its valley to peak size between IDs (F(2,805) = 91.938, p < .001). Post Hoc test (Tukey HSD) shows that the duration from valley to peak is significantly different (p < .001) between Easy (1.6Â±0.7s), Middle (2.1Â±0.9s), and Hard ID (2.7Â±1.1s).â€ù \ (4)	The 7th paragraph in Discussion (P8). â€œAlthough the peak pupil dilations of Easy and Middle ID show similar amount in Figure 10, the increase of pupil size from valley to peak is significantly different between all three IDs."" \ We also improved Fig. 10 by correcting an error in drawing the significance testing bars and changed all the corresponding descriptions (in the third, fourth, and sixth paragraphs in Statistical Analysis in P7, and also 6th paragraph in Discussion).  \ Discussion: \ In responding to R1â€™s suggestion to normalize the movement time by distance, we included a brief summary of our other recently accepted paper showing the pupil responses to either the distance or size of the target changes (Page 8, at the end of the second paragraph in Discussion) â€œAlthough it would be   interesting to see if the differences hold if the movement time is normalized by distance and then compared across the three difficulty levels in this study, we did not do that since our other research [18] showed the pupil dilations and the movement time in goal-directed movements still respect Fittsâ€™ Law by only changing the target distance or target distance.â€ù Plus we have included a reference to that new paper [18]. \ In order to answer the question that whether the pupil diameter change has the ability to measure task requirement in goal-directed movement in real-time for each targeting step alone (R1, R3, R4, and R5), we added a paragraph in Discussion (9th paragraph, Page 8) â€œThe 7s window approach i.e., averaging many repetitive task epochs to show the pattern of pupil size change may not have the ability to measure task requirement in real-time. However some features, such as the valley to peak pupil size dilation, the valley to peak duration, and the latency between the moments of tool-reach and peak pupil size can be employed to classify the task difficulty of each targeting step alone using techniques such as machine learning. The ANOVA results showed that all of these features have strong (p < .001) ability in distinguishing the three difficulty levels of task requirement.â€ù \ As suggested by R5, we expanded the discussion for specific steps needed to apply the presented approach in measuring the task difficulty from pupil diameter changes in real-time in practice, and added three paragraphs in the Discussion (Pages 8-9, 10th, 11th, and 12th paragraphs). â€œFor real-world application, several steps should be carefully considered. First, the critical moment of the movement e.g. the moment the tool/hand starts to move or reach, should be accurately detected as a timing marker of the movement event that the pupil responses to. Usually tool-leave is more promising as a movement event marker than tool-reach since in a complex movement such as surgical tasks [17] the tool may need extra actions at the end of movements such as grasping or releasing an object. One effective and robust way to detect tool-leave and tool-reach is to first find the moment of peak velocity of the tool movement and then search backward and forward to get tool start and reached moments, as presented here.  \ Second, the features of pupil size change should be extracted within a window in the vicinity of the movement start. The window size should be properly defined according to the property of the application, since if the window is too small or too wide, useful pupil information may be excluded, or false pupil information introduced.  \ Third, the baseline of pupil diameter used for deriving each relative pupil diameter change in the window should be carefully chosen. In the present discrete movement study, the selection of the position of the baseline is quite straightforward, i.e. between 2s to 3s before the tool-leave moment, which is near the end of the 10s waiting time and is right before the pupil starts to dilate. However in a real-world motor task where the movements may occur consecutively without a clear waiting time between them, it may be a challenge to select the position of the baseline.â€ù \ In responding to tone down the claim of this approach for other tasks (R1, R4, and R5), we changed 15th paragraph in Discussion to â€œSecond, the method by which we measured the task requirements using pupil diameter in a discrete elementary task, that is the ID-to-pupil mapping in this motor-coordination task, could be further applied to complex tasks which can be decomposed into several elementary tasks [14], and is a subject for future research.â€ù \ We also delete the paragraph originally in Discussion that could be mis-interpreted to claim that the present approach is validated to other physiological responses. â€œSecond, we demonstrated a new way to define the task requirement, using Fittsâ€™ index of difficulty (ID), in goal-directed interactions. This new baseline method can be further validated through evaluation of complementary physiological signals to expand the variety of methods for the measurement of the task workload during goal-directed movements. Our approach is applicable in a variety of situations where accurate estimation of workload is critical, e.g. surgical training and simulation environments.â€ù  (Deleted) \ All other suggestions of the reviewers were included. \ ",IxSc,Xianta Jiang,M Stella Atkins,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 13:19,pn728,A,SensaBubble: A Chrono-Sensory Mid-Air Display of Sight and Smell,Sue Ann,Seah,s.a.seah@bristol.ac.uk,pn0728-paper.pdf,10,letter,"Arial,Bold Times_New_Roman,Bold Times_New_Roman Times_New_Roman,Italic Arial,Italic Times_New_Roman,BoldItalic Arial",,"Sue Ann Seah, Diego Martinez Plasencia, Peter Bennett, Abhijit Karnik, Vlad Otrocol, Jarrod Knibbe, Andy Cockburn, Sriram Subramanian","s.a.seah@bristol.ac.uk, diego.martinez-plasencia@bristol.ac.uk, peter.bennett@bris.ac.uk, abe.karnik@gmail.com, vo0592@my.bristol.ac.uk, jarrod.knibbe@bristol.ac.uk, andrew.cockburn@canterbury.ac.nz, sriram@cs.bris.ac.uk",29769,Sue Ann,,Seah,s.a.seah@bristol.ac.uk,,University of Bristol,Bristol,,United Kingdom,,,,,,28400,Diego,,Martinez Plasencia,diego.martinez-plasencia@bristol.ac.uk,,University of Bristol,Bristol,,United Kingdom,,,,,,15567,Peter,,Bennett,peter.bennett@bris.ac.uk,,University of Bristol,Bristol,,United Kingdom,,,,,,15656,Abhijit,,Karnik,abe.karnik@gmail.com,,University of Bristol,Bristol,,United Kingdom,,University of Lancaster,Lancaster,,United Kingdom,37426,Vlad,,Otrocol,vo0592@my.bristol.ac.uk,,University of Bristol,Bristol,,United Kingdom,,,,,,28794,Jarrod,,Knibbe,jarrod.knibbe@bristol.ac.uk,,University of Bristol,Bristol,,United Kingdom,,,,,,1057,Andy,,Cockburn,andrew.cockburn@canterbury.ac.nz,,University of Canterbury,Christchurch,,New Zealand,,,,,,2491,Sriram,,Subramanian,sriram@cs.bris.ac.uk,,University of Bristol,Bristol,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We present SensaBubble, a chrono-sensory mid-air display system that generates scented bubbles to deliver information to the user via a number of sensory modalities.

When the human eye looks at an object, this object appears sharp on the retina, but objects at different distances appear blurred. \ Advances in gaze-tracking technologies enable us to reproduce dynamic depth of field in regular displays, providing an alternative way of conveying depth.  \ In this paper we investigate gaze-contingent depth of field as a method to produce realistic 3D images, and analyze how effectively people can use it to perceive depth.  \ We found that GC DOF increases subjective perceived realism and depth and can contribute to the perception of ordinal depth and distance between objects, but it is limited in its accuracy. \ ",Paper,Michael Mauderer,mm285@st-andrews.ac.uk,"1.

However, studies on exergame controllers mostly focus on designing new controllers and exploring specific application domains without analyzing human factors, such as performance, comfort, and effort. In this paper, we examine the characteristics of a speed-based exergame controller that bear on human factors related to body movement and exercise. Users performed tasks such as changing and maintaining exercise speed for avatar control while their performance was measured. The exergame controller follows Fittsâ€™ law, but requires longer movement time than a gamepad and Wiimote. As well, resistance force and target speed affect performance. User experience data confirm that the comfort and mental effort are adequate as practical game controllers.

We thoroughly addressed the reviewersâ€™ comments in the revised version, as follows. \  \ Appreciating the comments about the statistics in Table 2 (page 7), we changed the significance threshold of p = .05 into p= .01 throughout the table. With this, questionnaire items 9 (arm fatigue) and 10 (shoulder fatigue) are no longer significant. The supporting text has been adjusted accordingly. \  \ Following R3â€™s suggestion regarding user comfort, we added discussion on user comfort earlier in the paper with the research questions (page 3). We found that this issue is closely related with R2â€™s comment regarding the effect of exercise and physical ability. Therefore, we discussed the above two issues and their relationship. In addition, we revised and extended(?) the discussion on physical ability, such as differences in individual fitness levels, physical efforts of manipulating controllers, and resistance level of the exercise bikes (page 8). \  \ The comment of R3, regarding the block effect on movement time, has been addressed by providing detailed statistical information in page 6. As stated in the rebuttal, there is little difference between the results using the last block only and the results using blocks 6 to 10, in terms of the throughput and Fittsâ€™ law regression. Also, we revised the design of the Study 2, by clarifying the number of trials, as commented by R3. \  \ We clarified that the design of ExerPlanet is a demonstration of our findings from the experiments, not an implementation. As a part of our future works, we plan to evaluate actual user experience of the game as well as to provide a real demonstration soon. \  \ As commented by R5, we clarified the cases of actually implemented speed-based exergames in the Related Work section. The examples in Figure 1 are the games using one-dimensional control, which are highly compatible with speed-based exergame controllers. \  \ We updated the out-of-date reference [14] as suggested by R3, and corrected all the typos and wrong reference numbers throughout the paper. All other comments from the reviewers are addressed respectfully. \  \  \ ---- \  \ minor updates, Jan 13 - fixed figure numbers (3 and 4)",games,Taiwoo Park,Uichin Lee,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 15:36,pn739,A,Exploring the Acceptability of Google Glass as an Everyday Assistive Device for People with Parkinsonâ€™s,Roisin,McNaney,r.mcnaney@newcastle.ac.uk,pn0739-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Roisin McNaney, John Vines, Daniel Roggen, Madeline Balaam, Pengfei Zhang, Ivan Poliakov, Patrick Olivier","r.mcnaney@newcastle.ac.uk, john.vines@ncl.ac.uk, daniel.roggen@ieee.org, madeline.balaam@ncl.ac.uk, pengfei.zhang@ncl.ac.uk, ivan.poliakov@ncl.ac.uk, p.l.olivier@ncl.ac.uk",17092,Roisin,,McNaney,r.mcnaney@newcastle.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,21260,John,,Vines,john.vines@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,38158,Daniel,,Roggen,daniel.roggen@ieee.org,School of Engineering and Informatics,University of Sussex,Brighton,,United Kingdom,,,,,,8726,Madeline,,Balaam,madeline.balaam@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,38737,Pengfei,,Zhang,pengfei.zhang@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,38748,Ivan,,Poliakov,ivan.poliakov@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,5105,Patrick,,Olivier,p.l.olivier@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We describe a qualitative study investigating the acceptability of the Google Glass  eyewear computer to people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD).

Assuming two visual search strategies, serial and directed, and a pointing sub-task, it captures the change of performance with five fac- tors: 1) menu length, 2) menu organization, 3) target posi- tion, 4) absence/presence of target, and 5) practice. The novel aspect is that the model is expressed as probability density distribution of gaze, which allows for deriving total selec- tion time. We present novel data that replicates and extends the Nielsen menu selection paradigm and uses eye-tracking and mouse tracking to confirm model predictions. The same parametrization yielded a high fit to both menu selection time and gaze distributions. The model has the potential to im- prove menu designs by helping designers identify more ef- fective solutions without conducting empirical studies.",Paper,Gilles Bailly,gilles.bailly@telecom-paristech.fr,"1.

This technique minimizes cursor movement, while taking into consideration of the precision of cursor movement at different speeds. It also ensures that only one target is captured at any time.

However, the human finger has considerably large fingertip size and finger input is imprecise. As such, acquiring small targets on a touch screen is still a challenging task. In this paper, we present the \\emph{LinearDragger}, a new and integrated one-finger target acquisition technique for small and clustered targets. The proposed method has three advantages. First, it allows users to select targets in dense clustered groups easily with a single touch-drag-release operation. Second, it maps the 2D selection problem into a more precise 1D selection problem, which is independent of the target distribution. Third, it avoids finger occlusion and does not create visual distraction. As a result, it is particularly suitable for applications with dense targets and rich visual elements. Results of our controlled experiments show that when selecting small targets, \\emph{LinearDragger} takes about 70\\% and 30\\% less selection time than target acquisition without using any techniques and with the state-of-the-art target acquisition technique that involves a single touch operation, respectively, while maintaining a reasonable error rate.",Paper,Xiaojun Su,xiaojun.su88@gmail.com,"1.

The details are as follows. \  \ === Main Concerns === \  \ About result and discussion [R1]: \ As suggested by R1, we have now improved the results and discussion sections of both the preliminary studies and the main study as follows: \ 1)	We have placed the results into separate subsections from the discussions. \ 2)	We have replaced the original Tables 1 and 2 with text description in Preliminary Study 1. We have also combined the tables with similar patterns in the Main Experiment. (See Tables 1 â€“ 4 of the revised paper.) \ 3)	In the result subsection of the Main experiment, we have added detailed description of the post-hoc tests that we have conducted. We updated the presentation of the post-hoc test results using a rank based system, which seems to be much clearer than the original presentation. \  \ About the recruitment and compensation of participants [R4] \ We have added the details about the recruitment and compensation in a Participants subsection of Preliminary Study 1. \  \ About the limitation of our method [R2, R4, R5] \ We have added a Limitations subsection to discuss the limitations of our method (namely, the dependence on prior knowledge of target information, selection of arbitrary screen point, and overriding of the dragging operation) in the Conclusion section of the revised paper. \  \ About the comparison with existing methods [R1] \ As discussed in the rebuttal, TapTap ([21] of the revised paper) involves multiple tapping operations and belongs to a different category of methods. Hence, we did not compare our method with TapTap. Nevertheless, we have added this to the revised paper as a potential future work to conduct a broader range of performance evaluation on all selection operation types. \  \ === Minor Concerns === \  \ About the size of ROI in Preliminary Study 1 [R1] \ We have re-run the user study in Preliminary Study 1 with two smaller ROI sizes. Results show that when the size of the ROI is too small, it is much harder for the participants to specify the ROI so as to include the desired target. Hence, the participants needed to redo the selection, which affected the overall performance. \  \ About implementation details of the main experiment [R5] \ In the main experiment, we have explained the zero escalation time used by Shift and clarified that we had disabled the target expansion feature for LinearDragger in order to provide a fair evaluation. \  \ About the unit of the target sizes [R1] \ We have updated all the numbers to include the measurement unit (in mm). \  \ About precise description in the Abstract [R1] \ In the Abstract, we have added a description on the performance difference between LinearDragger and the state-of-the-art method.  \  \ About additional citation [R2, R3] \ We have added the suggested references ([4], [7] and [13] of the revised paper) to the Introduction section and the Related Work section. \ ",,Oscar Kin-Chung Au,Xiaojun Su,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:48,pn757,A,"Now You See Me, Now You Don't - Protecting Smartphone Authentication from Shoulder Surfers",Alexander,De Luca,alexander.de.luca@ifi.lmu.de,pn0757-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Alexander De Luca, Marian Harbach, Emanuel von Zezschwitz, Max-Emanuel Maurer, Bernhard Slawik, Heinrich Hussmann, Matthew Smith","alexander.de.luca@ifi.lmu.de, harbach@dcsec.uni-hannover.de, emanuel.von.zezschwitz@ifi.lmu.de, max.maurer@ifi.lmu.de, bernhard.slawik@ifi.lmu.de, hussmann@ifi.lmu.de, smith@dcsec.uni-hannover.de",8064,Alexander,,De Luca,alexander.de.luca@ifi.lmu.de,Media Informatics Group,University of Munich (LMU),Munich,Bavaria,Germany,,,,,,28646,Marian,,Harbach,harbach@dcsec.uni-hannover.de,Usable Security and Privacy Lab,Leibniz University Hannover,Hannover,,Germany,,,,,,16502,Emanuel,,von Zezschwitz,emanuel.von.zezschwitz@ifi.lmu.de,Media Informatics Group,University of Munich (LMU),Munich,Bavaria,Germany,,,,,,16799,Max-Emanuel,,Maurer,max.maurer@ifi.lmu.de,Media Informatics Group,University of Munich (LMU),Munich,Bavaria,Germany,,,,,,37438,Bernhard,,Slawik,bernhard.slawik@ifi.lmu.de,Media Informatics Group,University of Munich (LMU),Munich,Bavaria,Germany,,,,,,9993,Heinrich,,Hussmann,hussmann@ifi.lmu.de,Media Informatics Group,University of Munich (LMU),Munich,Bavaria,Germany,,,,,,18407,Matthew,,Smith,smith@dcsec.uni-hannover.de,Usable Security and Privacy Lab,Leibniz UniversitÃ_t Hannover,Hannover,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper, we present XSide, an authentication mechanism that uses the front and the back of smartphones to enter stroke-based passwords.

It begins with an analysis of RtD abstracts in the ACM digital library using a corpus query system called Sketch Engine. It identifies an emerging language and structure in academic abstracts on Research through Design. The abstracts frame a problem space, introduce a study, often involving the deployment of a prototype, and conclude with considerations, reflections and discussion. This format is pastiched in a series of design fictions written for the â€œdigital originalsâ€ù project investigating new and emerging forms of reproduction in Art. The fictions take the form of â€œimaginary abstractsâ€ù which summarize findings of papers that have not been written about prototypes that do not exist. It is argued that framing concept designs as fictional studies can provide a space for research focused critique and development. ",Paper,Mark Blythe,mark.blythe@northumbria.ac.uk,"1.

I have also followed the suggestions of the second AC.  \  \ There are changes throughout to make the argument more clear, add depth to the context and finesse the difference between design fiction and other techniques such as scenarios personas and so on.  The main changes addressing this context are in the introduction, the section on Scenarios and Personas and the discussion though other changes have been made throughout to make the argument more clear. \  \ As indicated in the rebuttal I have shown how the imaginary abstract technique might be applied to other research contexts by adding a new fiction addressing a different topic â€“ the care of ageing populations. A complete imaginary abstract addressing this topic has been added to the section before the discussion.   \  \ As suggested by the second AC I have also added a summary of the research through design abstract analysis as well as several disclaimers setting the tone of the piece as a provocative essay and hopefully mitigating the risk of misinterpretation. These occur at the end of the introduction , the section before the imaginary abstracts and in the paragraph beginning â€œTo be clearâ€ù in the discussion. \  \ The paper has been thoroughly revised in line with all of the comments and suggestions from the reviewers and ACs. These were all extremely helpful and Iâ€™m very grateful to all concerned so thanks again.

Yet, studies show that when people are able to resist their desires for unhealthy choices, they experience pride and satisfaction. In order to alleviate the former and support the latter, we designed, implemented and tested a mobile application for improving snacking behavior. Our application delivers a food craving reduction intervention at the moment of need and allows users to track how often they successfully resisted cravings. Our craving reduction intervention is based on recent research that shows that food cravings can be reduced through imagery techniques. We conducted a week-long evaluation of our application, comparing the effectiveness of our application to a basic tracking application. We found that our imagery application significantly reduced both overall snacking and unhealthy snacking compared to a simple snack-tracking application. ",Paper,Anne Hsu,anne.hsu@eecs.qmul.ac.uk,"1.

We designed and tested a mobile app to help users reduce cravings in order to promote healthier snacking habits.,"Revision report: \ All the content we promised in our response (see below for reference copy) has been provided in the new version of our paper.  We also included additional changes in response to the fifth reviewerâ€™s (AC2â€™s) additional comments, which were not required, but which we felt helped to improve our paper even more. \ These include: \ -Highlighting the novelty of our paper. \ -Removing the quantitative results of the prototype evaluation, which reviewers felt was not informative. \ -Including the results of post-experiment questionnaires regarding consumption of unhealthy snacks. \ -Clarifying the differences and similarities between the full app and the tracker app we used for the control condition and verifying the functional and procedural similarities between the two so that the comparison was valid. \ -Including the effects of usage over time in all of our analyses and using repeated measures statistics. \ -Adding a note saying we also repeated our analyses of Likert scales assuming ordinal data using Wilcoxon rank sum test for equal medians, and all of our analysis results were virtually unchanged. \ -Adding a section summarizing results from our qualitative interview. See section on â€œQualitative Resultsâ€ù. \ -Adding a greatly extended discussion section including more detailed description of why iCrave appeared to be effective, suggested broader benefits of iCrave, open questions and design implications. \ -Explaining that we chose the terminology of â€˜savingsâ€™ because we wanted to encourage the idea that forgoing immediate rewards should allow for greater rewards later, so we called this event a â€˜savingâ€™ of the craving on the app.   \ -Explaining why we chose the 20 minutes interval in which new savings could not be recorded, based on previous research on how long the brain takes to register post-consumption experiences. \ -Clarifying the difference between the prototype lite app and the tracker app used in the control condition. \ -Including summary of results of qualitative interviews of 13 people who had used our lite prototype app for a week. We also interviewed 13 participants and asked them about their experience using the app. To evaluate usability, we had asked how easy/hard they felt the app was to use; they all reported it was very usable. â€˜Very easyâ€™, â€˜simpleâ€™, â€˜convenientâ€™, â€˜very user friendly, I like it very muchâ€™. The main complaints were all centred on the fact that it wasnâ€™t deployed as an app and only as a mobile site. \ Response to reviews were as follows (for reference): \ We thank the reviewers for their supportive and helpful comments. We provide clarifications below. As recommended by reviewers, room for this new material can be made by reducing text on the initial pilot study.   \  \ NOVELTY: Previous lab studies only measured self-reported decrease in craving levels. Subsequent intake was never measured. Our work provides the first support that this method of craving reduction actually reduces consumption.    \  \ DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAIN VS. LITE APPS: Apps were identical except for the imagery task, vividness rating, and choice of recording â€˜savingsâ€™. This is a difference of 10 seconds and one click. Thus we provide the assurances R2 wanted: the lite app looked exactly like Fig. 1 except that the two center screens were omitted, the â€˜save for laterâ€™ button was not available in the right screen, and the â€˜savedâ€™ tally was not available on the home screen. As with the full iCrave, iCrave lite users were asked to use the button when they experienced a craving and indicate whether they were going to consume a healthy or unhealthy snack before eating. Thus, any biases from reporting consumption beforehand would have applied to both groups.    \  \ ANALYSIS FOR UNDER-REPORTING CONCERNS: We also asked participants at the end of the study how many unhealthy snacks they consumed over the week. These results suggested participants in both conditions under-reported on the apps: participants in both conditions reported more unhealthy snacking in the post-questionnaire than their app usage indicated. However, when we compared unhealthy snack consumption based on post-experiment reports, participants in the main condition still consumed significantly fewer unhealthy snacks, F(1,51)=4.2, p=0.04.   \  \ STATS WITH TIME DEPENDENCE AND REPEATED MEASURES: We have re-analyzed the data using repeated-measures analyses and the fixed effect of time (days into expt) and regressions to observe usage with time as requested. All of our results remain unchanged with the new analyses. Overall usage and healthy snacks consumed did slightly decrease with time. Difference in usage patterns across conditions was marginal to non-significant and doesnâ€™t support any alternative interpretation of our results. Updated stats below:    \  \ Usage: Usage means a user pressed the iCrave button to initiate app use. No sig. effect of condition, p=.39. Sig. effect of time F(6,306)=2.71, p=.014, with marginal interaction p=.09. Plots showed that, while usage varied over days, overall decrease with time was small. OLS-Pooled Errors regression fit to the usage data w/ parameters of condition and time found slope for time was -.048, t(369)=2.8, p=.005. OLS-PE fits to individual conditions found: slope= -.04, t(180)=2.9, p=.004 (for main) and slope=-.05 t(187)=1.69, p=.09 (for lite).    \  \ Unhealthy snacks: Sig. effect of condition F(1,306)=14.5, p=.0004, no effects of time p=.43, and no interaction, p=.29.   \  \ Healthy snacks: no sig. effect of condition p=.27, sig. effect of time F(6,306)=2.37, p=.03, no interaction, p=.5.   \  \ Overall snacks: Sig. effect of condition F(1,306)=9.2, p=.004.  Sig. effect of time F(6,306)=2.36, p=.03. Marginal interaction, p=.092.  As before, OLS-PE regression was fit to the full data with param. of condition and time found time to be -.045, t(369)=2.7, p=.007. Fits to individual conditions separately found time slope=-.039, t(180)=2.8, p=.006 (for main) and slope=-.05 t(187)=1.69, p=.09, (for lite).     \  \ LIKERT: Treating Likert responses as interval data is common practice. However, as R2 suggested, we also re-analyzed our Likert responses assuming ordinal data and used Wilcoxon rank sum test for equal medians. All results and significance values remained virtually the same.   \  \ QUALITATIVE DATA: We did collect data from post-interviews with main iCrave users. Our interviews showed that iCrave caused participants to either no longer want a snack at all, or choose a healthy snack instead. Quotes about using the app include: â€œBefore I wanted a cookie, (after) I felt it was better that I did not eat a cookieâ€ù, â€œthere is a loss of appetiteâ€ù, â€œmakes me feel I donâ€™t want to eat snacksâ€ù, â€œI feel like I can control myselfâ€ù, â€œattraction of snacks is reducedâ€ù.  Quotes for moments when healthy snacks were chosen instead: â€œBefore, I wanted chocolate immediately. (Afterwards) I preferred the vegetable salad.â€ù â€œIt made me prefer healthy food.â€ù â€œI wanted chips, but afterwards, I felt it is better to eat something healthy.â€ù Users felt good about healthier choices: â€œI felt good avoiding the popcorn.â€ù â€œIt was a good feeling to avoid the ice creamâ€ù. â€œI felt happy to change the choice of food so my life can be healthier. However (as shown in our data) there were still occasions where iCrave users chose unhealthy snacks after using the app. Quotes about moments when iCrave didnâ€™t improve snacking include: â€œI felt it could not help me this time.â€ù â€œNothing changed, both before and after using the app I still wanted chicken."" \ ",,Anne Hsu,Ann Blandford,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/17/14 14:12,pn763,A,"A Pool of Dreams : Facebook, Politics and the Emergence of a Social Movement",Clara,Crivellaro,c.crivellaro@ncl.ac.uk,pn0763-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Clara Crivellaro, Rob Comber, John Bowers, Peter Wright, Patrick Olivier","c.crivellaro@ncl.ac.uk, robert.comber@newcastle.ac.uk, john.m.bowers@gmail.com, p.c.wright@newcastle.ac.uk, p.l.olivier@ncl.ac.uk",37441,Clara,,Crivellaro,c.crivellaro@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,22329,Rob,,Comber,robert.comber@newcastle.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,30646,John,,Bowers,john.m.bowers@gmail.com,Culture Lab,Newcastle University ,Newcastle Upon Tyne ,,United Kingdom,,,,,,9063,Peter,,Wright,p.c.wright@newcastle.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,5105,Patrick,,Olivier,p.l.olivier@ncl.ac.uk,Culture Lab,Newcastle University,Newcastle Upon Tyne,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper we present insights from an empirical analysis of data from an emergent social movement primarily located on a Facebook page to contribute understanding of the conduct of everyday politics in social media and through this open up research agendas for HCI.

Unfortunately, their size and weight is proportional to the size of what they actuate. We present haptic turk, a different approach to motion platforms that is light and mobile. The key idea is to replace motors and mechanical components with humans. All haptic turk setups consist of a player who is supported by one or more turkers. The player enjoys an interactive experience, such as a flight simulation. The motion in the playerâ€™s experience is generated by the turkers who manually lift, tilt, and push the player's limbs or torso. To get the timing and force right, timed motion instructions in a format familiar from rhythm games are displayed on turkersâ€™ mobile devices, which they attach to the playerâ€™s body. We demonstrate a range of installations based on mobile phones, projectors, and head-mounted displays. In our user study, participants rated not only the experience as player as enjoyable (6.1/7), but also the experience as a turker (4.4/7).

In particular, a real time unpredictable event is difficult to handle in our current system. For example, if players controlling a racing game swerve and hit a wall, this hit is difficult to predict. This makes the event difficult to haptically render by our system, as it does not leave enough time to properly prepare actuators for their action. Haptic turk runs in to similar issues if multiple events become possible at a given moment.â€ù \  \ ### 4b) use of ""turkers"" \  \ We replaced â€œturkersâ€ù with â€œhuman-actuatorsâ€ù in the Abstract and in the beginning of the Introduction and abbreviated it to â€œactuatorsâ€ù later on. \  \  \ FIRST REVISION \  \ Thank you again for supporting our paper--we know that shepherding means extra work for you and we appreciate it. \  \  \ Here are our changes \  \ ### 1) Re-formulate the paper to put more emphasis of the contribution as \   a specific experience (or a game) and *significantly* less of a generic \   approach/platform for haptics. \  \ We reduced the emphasis on being a generic approach to haptics by \  \ - taking out the interactive force feedback section in the Related Work. \  \ - toning down the statement in the Contribution by dropping this paragraph which was part of the original submission (It used to read ""While, at first glance haptic turk may appear to be a video game system, we argue that it is general purpose approach to providing users with physical actuationâ€”is it would normally be administered by motion platforms or similar haptics equipment. This concept extends beyond motion and haptics, as we illustrated using the water and heat special effects in the walkthrough."") \  \ - We replaced ""generic haptics"" with ""motion experience"" throughout the paper. \  \  \  \ ### 2) Real-time limitations and potential solutions need to be much more \   prominently discussed (follow R2 suggestions).  \  \ In the limitations section, after ""Limitations of our approach include that it requires multiple people, is tiring, and that human turkers cannot rival a computerized motion platform in terms of responsiveness and reliability."" \ we added: \ 	""In particular, truly unexpected events, such a driver crashing into a guard rails do not leave enough time to properly prepare turkers for the action. Similarly, if a larger number of events are possible at a given moment, Haptic Turk cannot prepare turkers for all of them, as the â€œbandwidthâ€ù of the Turker display is limited."" \  \  \  \ ### 3) For clarity, the revised paper should minimize hinting of being \   similar to crowdsourcing. Specifically, the claim that this system \   crowdsources haptics needs to be removed and I would suggest that the \   authors re-formulate their claims along the lines of suggestions from \   R2 and R5 that this is really a WoZ system. \ AND  \   4) That said, I don't think that all mentions of crowdsourcing need to \   be removed, but I would suggest that you constrain this to a specific \   section which discusses similarities and contrasts to crowdsourcing (or \   even better ""friendsourcing"" - See Bernstein et al.'s TOCHI paper). For \   the rest of the paper, please restrain from using such terminology,  \   since it definitely confused the readers. \  \ To clarify that we are not crowdsourcing, we removed our related work subsection on crowdsourcing and instead inserted this new one that says that we are different from crowdsourcing and that we share some characteristics with Wizard of Oz. \  \ ""Wizard of Oz and Crowdsourcing \ Haptic Turk shares some characteristics with Wizard of Oz systems, such as the aforementioned Turk [18], Researchers use the wizard of oz method to speed up proto-typing [6] and to give users new experiences [7]. \ Haptic Turk is different from crowdsourcing, such as Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk (www.mturk.com/mturk), which focus on recruiting workers. However, haptic turk could use crowdsourcing platform such as TaskRabbit (www.taskrabbit.com), CommunitySourcing [13] and Friendsourcing [3] to help recruit turkers."" \  \  \ ### 4b) Along those same lines, you should find a different term for  \    â€œturkersâ€ù since that is very evocative of the crowdsourcing  \    solutions today. R5 suggests ""wizards"", but I leave that decision  \    up to you. \  \ We really want to comply, but are struggling. We ran the term wizards by a bunch of people and it seemed to lead to confusion, as wizards are by definition hidden from the user while especially in the iPhone version turkers were clearly visible at all times. Given that the new version of the paper clarifies the origin of the work, is there any way we can talk you into letting us hold on to the term turkers? \  \  \  \ ### 5) While I'd suggest changing it, the name ""Haptic Turk"" may be  \   retained. If you opt for keeping the name, the motivation for the  \   name (as outlined in the rebuttal) should be included in the  \   beginning of the paper.  \  \ We did retain the name (thanks for giving us the option) and in the beginning of our introduction we clarified that our use of the name is based on the 18th century chess automatonâ€”The Turk ""Haptic turk is a motion platform based on people. The name is inspired by the 18th century chess automaton â€œThe Turkâ€ù [20] that was powered by a human chess master. \  \  \ ### 6) The related work section can be reduced (see suggestions from R5), \    and that space should be used to provide more details on both  \   evaluations (again see R5). \  \ We reduced the related work section by \ - taking out the original crowdsourcing subsection, as mentioned above \ - taking out the interactive force feedback sections force-enhanced controllers and interactive force feedback), as mentioned above \  \ In addition, we extended the study section by adding material about the interesting question of whether players and turkers think of the human-experience as a good or bad thing (and the answer is that it polarizes them): \  \ [CHART] Figure 23: Some participants preferred haptic turk, other would have preferred a mechanical motion platform. \  \ 5 \  \ 4					[] \ 					[] \ 3		[]			[] \ 		[]			[] \ 2	[]	[]	[]	[]	[] \ 	[]	[]	[]	[]	[] \ 1	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]		[] \ 	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]		[] \ 0_______[]______[]_____	[]______[]______[]______________[]___ \ 	1	2	3	4	5	6	7 \ prefer machine					   prefer human \  \  \ In addition, we polished the paper, for example, we made Figure 8, 12, 13, 22 clearer. \ - add an arrow below the player (figure 8) \ - add a count down number (figure 12) \ - change the color of probe lines.

Performing personalization exclusively at the client side (e.g., on oneâ€™s smartphone) may conceptually increase privacy, because no data is sent to a remote provider. But does client-side personalization (CSP) also increase usersâ€™ perception of privacy?  \  \ We developed a causal model of privacy attitudes and behavior in personalization, and validated it in an experiment that contrasted CSP with personalization at three remote providers: Amazon, a fictitious company, and the â€œCloudâ€ù. Participants gave roughly the same amount of personal data and tracking permissions in all four conditions. A structural equation modeling analysis reveals the reasons: CSP raises the fewest privacy concerns, but does not lead in terms of perceived protection nor in resulting self-anticipated satisfaction and thus privacy-related behavior. Encouragingly, we found that adding certain security features to CSP is likely to raise its perceived protection significantly. Our model predicts that CSP will then also sharply improve on all other privacy measures. \ ",Paper,Alfred Kobsa,kobsa@uci.edu,"1. Ahmed, R. and Ho, S.Y.

In some settings, such as mental health care, access to end-users is often constrained. This is a particular difficulty given that the experience of those with mental illness can be difficult for researchers to understand, and is further complicated by its associated stigma. In addition, the therapeutic setting is outside the common experience of most people and protected from outside intrusion. Although role-play has been used in varied ways in HCI, rarely has it been defined with sufficient clarity to enable others to deploy it in a nuanced manner. We argue that role-play is particularly suited for use in mental healthcare settings and, when used judiciously, can address some of the difficulties associated with working in this setting. This paper details a range of role-play formats appropriated from therapeutic role-play, drawing upon the HCI and mental health literature, therapist input and our experience of using role-play for a number of purposes at different stages of the development process. We consider how and why role-play can be used to generate empathy, gain understanding of therapy, provide feedback on designs before clinical use and help train therapists in using technology in the treatment room.

Physical co-location within a shared space is an important element in all these collaborative scenarios. Technology such as the multi-touch interactive tabletop has provided new opportunities for game designers to create co-located face-to-face collaborative games that can emulate such environments.â€ù \  \ Removed THE IMMDIT SYSTEM SETUP section describing the architectural framework. Technical details not too relevant to the focus of the paper. In replacement, we added details of the actual hardware used in the IMMDIT system in the INTRODUCTION. The revised sentences read â€_ â€œWe developed the Integrated Multiple Mobile Devices and Interactive Tabletop (IMMDIT) system shown in Figure 1. A maximum of four Samsung (GT-I9070) mobile phones interfaces with the Samsung SUR40 interactive tabletop through a unique visual tag that identifies the mobile device,â€_.â€ù  \  \ Stated the target age group clearly in the start of the Collaborative Game Design Objective section. We qualified that the objective of the game design in the paper is targeted  towards 4 to 12 year olds.  \  \ Cited nine (9) additional relevant references in the RELATED WORK section. Included short discussion of findings in these papers and how they support the approach and motivations adopted in this work. Additional sentences in the RELATED WORK sections include the following: \  \ Early relevant co-located collaborative work: \ â€œStewart et al. [22] proposed the Single Display Groupware (SDG) as a model for supporting collaborative work among users that are physically co-located. Their preliminary work back in 1999 revealed both benefits and shortcoming of co-present collaboration based on their proposed technological setup. Moraveji et al. [15] studied a larger group of 1 to 32 children interacting with their respective mice while jointly viewing a single large display in a classroom scenario. Their findings seem to suggest that large group sizes have minimal impact on performance if the visual targets the children are required to point to are of a reasonable size. Multiple mobile phones have also been used with shared single display in a children educational game called Electric Agent created by Ballagas et al. [2].â€ù  \  \ Examples of some commercial co-located collaborative systems: \ â€œCo-located computer-supported activities are also available commercially. Some examples include Sifteo Cubes [14], Combiform [24] and arcade games like Konamiâ€™s Dance Dance Revolution [11].â€ù   \  \ Additional examples of work that integrated tabletop with tangible objects: \ â€œAntle et al. [1] designed a hybrid tangible and multi-touch land use planning game called Youtopia as a platform to investigate how codependent tangible access on a shared tabletop can be used to support effective collaboration among children.â€ù \  \ Recent work and findings of co-located collaborative activities using mobile phones and shared display: \ â€œLucero et al. [12] found that people are generally concerned about sharing their personal phones unless it is with people they know and trust. This seems to support the notion of mobile phone being viewed as a personal or private space. However, they did find that most participants in their studies felt that the benefit of engaging in co-located social interactions using their phones outweighed the potential negative implications of sharing. Their caveat is that the interaction designer must be able to deliver useful and engaging mobile co-located experiences to the users. This work proposes an interaction design framework that can guide the design of engaging interactive activities within such co-located private-public spaces.â€ù \  \ Corrected several typo errors, e.g. in DIMENSION OF INTERACTION DESIGN section in the original submission. â€œThe Ours (O) common space represent the shared resources,..â€ù was changed to â€œThe Ours (O) common space represents the shared resources,..â€ù \ Another in the ABSTRACT. â€œâ€_for designing collaborative play activities in environments that combines both private and shared interactive spaces.â€ù Was changed to â€œfor designing collaborative play activities in environments that combine both private and shared interactive spaces.â€ù \  \ Highlighted design configuration that generated highest level of excitement at the end of the DISCUSSION section. Included the sentence â€œIn summary, we observed the highest levels of excitement and engagment during the collection activities (OM) and complex shared task (OY). In addition, we noted gender preferences for the different MOY interactions, with the girls preferring sharing activities like item exchange (MY-YM) and the boys preferring present collection and shared challenges (OM-OY and MO-YO).â€ù \  \ Listed the following additional references: \ 1.

Video Timeline extends the commonly employed list-based visualization for navigation history by applying size to indicate heuristics and occupying the full screen with a two-sided timeline. Video Tiles visualizes history items in a grid-based layout by following pre-defined templates based on items' heuristics and ordering, utilizing screen space more effectively at the expense of a clearer temporal location. The visualizations are compared against the state-of-the-art method (a filmstrip-based visualization), with ten participants tasked with sharing their previously-seen affective intervals. Our study shows that our visualizations are perceived as intuitive and both outperform and are strongly preferred to the current method. Based on these results, Video Timeline and Video Tiles provide an effective addition to video viewers to help manage the growing quantity of video.

Thus, the goal of this research is to extend the work for multiple-videos history by testing different design layouts that support this activity in a visual manner and allow users to manage their history, and evaluate the benefits this brings. \  \ In the subsection titled: History Record Representation Structure \  \ The principle goal of our interface is to provide efficient access to previously viewed videos, and in particular, the intervals viewed within those videos. We accomplish this by applying our approach, described in [1], where a continuous video history is recorded for the user as they consume video. \  \ In the evaluation section under header titled: List  \  \ The List visualization simply displays the history segments on one vertical strip as shown on the left of Figure 10, where these segments are organized on a reversed chronological order having the last viewed segment at the top of the list. This layout is our previous visualization [1] with the exception of having varied sizes for the thumbnails.  \  \  \ ïÅ—	R6 comment about user study is not clear that it looks at visualizations of multiple video (You claim the difference with this work is that you look at visualization of multiple videos, not just one. Yet, from the user study I doubt this. It is unclear.  The filmstrip view is contextual to the current video. The Video timeline and Video tiles could be either just of the current video, or could be of segments from multiple different videos.  The filmstrip view cannot do this. Therefore to be valid, you can only look at one video at a time. I.e. you would need to load a new video and view only its video timeline or video tiles. So I don't see how this really pushes beyond the single video case.). We address this by explaining in more detail about how single video viewing compares with using the history view that contains multiple videos in the following section5: \  \ Before the subsection titled: Design \  \ We also tested whether these history visualizations performed better than without detailed history where users simply find a video from a grid of previously seen videos (Figure 3) and then search for intervals using the single video's filmstrip (similar to what they would have in an online video website such as YouTube). \  \  \ In the subsection titled: Design \  \ For each clip, participants had to find the corresponding video first using either inter-video history (Figure 6) when one of the proposed visualizations was experimented, or the videos library (Figure 3) when Filmstrip was tested. After finding the video, participants searched for the questioned clip using the provided layout.  \  \  \ ïÅ—	R6 comment about post-hoc tests:  \  \ We explicitly mention the post-hoc analysis in the results and discussions section.  \  \ A post-hoc analysis showed that the filmstrip had significantly more previews and took more time than the other two modes, as we hypothesized.  \  \  \ ïÅ—	 R6 comment â€œWhilst the size of the history thumbnails and what this means is discussed in the video, they aren't mentioned in the textâ€ù \  \ We discuss this in paragraph 5 of the subsection titled: Video Navigation Interface \  \  \ Segment size is determined based on a weight factor which is derived from how often this segment has been viewed and the duration of the segment. For our study we used a weight factor of 75% of the peak view count plus 25% of the duration in minutes (normalized duration is not used to ensure small videos are not biased to a larger size).  \  \  \ ïÅ—	 R6 comment about trying to explain both the pilot and the actual experiment description at the same time was very confusing \  \ The table was removed to reduce the confusion and to provide more space to address the other points. \  \ ïÅ—	R1 comment about not including commercial video services such as Netflix \  \ We have included  comment in the related work along with YouTube as follows: \  \ In the timeline-based visualization, history consists of a linear scrollable list of thumbnails, which appear in reverse chronological order: the most recently visited page is at the top of the list, and clicking on any of these thumbnails (or icons) redirects the user to the corresponding web page. Most web browsers, YouTube, Netflix, Hodgkinson [8] and Girgensohn et. al [6] use this visualization to represent the history of user's visited content as shown in Figure 2(a), where clicking on one of the thumbnails navigates to the corresponding content. \  \  \ ïÅ—	 R1 comment about desktop vs. touch and mobile devices as there was disagreement amongst reviews about this point: \  \ nothing has been added for this \  \ ïÅ—	 R1 comment about laboratory study as there was disagreement amongst reviews about this point: \  \ nothing has been added for this \  \  \ ïÅ—	R3 comment about state the number of participants in the study earlier  \ It has been mentioned in the abstract to emphasize the number. \  \ ïÅ—	R3 comment about including other references such as video search (Matejka et. al (2013) Swifter:) and document navigation work (Cockburn et. al (2006), Faster document navigation with space-filling thumbnails) \  \ Cockburn citation has been included in the second paragraph of the results section: \  \ If the scrolling event is disabled following [4], then thumbnails size will shrink as the history builds up making the thumbnails difficult to identify. As is known with visualization scalability of any system there is a trade off between size and scrolling or zooming needs.  \  \ Matejka citation was not included since we are not discussing video search in the literature, as this does not appear as relevant as the other addition and space is limited. \  \ ïÅ—	R3 comment about repositioning figures: \ We tried to reposition figures so that they are closer to the location when they were first discussed. \ ",,Abir Al-Hajri,Gregor Miller,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:05,pn799,A,Jump and Shoot! - Prioritizing Primary and Alternative Body Gestures for Intense Gameplay,Chaklam,Silpasuwanchai,chaklam.chong@gmail.com,pn0799-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Chaklam Silpasuwanchai, Xiangshi Ren","chaklam.chong@gmail.com, ren.xiangshi@kochi-tech.ac.jp",27516,Chaklam,,Silpasuwanchai,chaklam.chong@gmail.com,,Kochi University of Technology,Kami,Kochi,Japan,,,,,,2035,Xiangshi,,Ren,ren.xiangshi@kochi-tech.ac.jp,,Kochi University of Technology,Kami,Kochi,Japan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Motion gestures enable natural and intuitive input in video games.  However, game gestures designed by developers may not always be the optimal gestures for players. A key challenge in designing appropriate game gestures lies in the interaction-intensive nature of video games, i.e., several actions/commands may need to be executed concurrently using different body parts.  This study analyzes user preferences in game gestures, with the aim of accommodating high interactivity during gameplay.   Two user-elicitation studies were conducted: first, to determine user preferences, participants were asked to define gestures for common game actions/commands; second, to develop effective combined-gestures, participants were asked to define possible game gestures using each body part (one and two hands, one and two legs, head, eyes, and torso).  Our study presents a set of suitable and alternative body parts for common game actions/commands.  We also present some simultaneously applied game gestures that assist interaction in highly interactive game situations (e.g., selecting a weapon with the feet while shooting with the hand).  Interesting design implications are further discussed, e.g., transferability between hand and leg gestures.",Note,Chaklam Silpasuwanchai,chaklam072@gmail.com,"1. Bianchi-Berthouze, N.

However, a focus on financial success of crowdfunding has obscured the fact that over 58% of crowdfunding projects fail to achieve their funding goals. This population of failed creatives however, gives us an audience to study public creative failure in an online environment. We draw inspiration from work in organizational behavior on failure, and work in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) on online behavior, to study online public failure. Using a mixed-methods approach with data scraped from Kickstarter and interview data with failed crowdfunding project creators, we answer the following question: What do project creators on crowdfunding platforms learn and change through the process of failing? We find that creators who relaunch their projects succeed 43% of the time, and that most individuals find failure to be a positive experience. We conclude the paper with a series of design implications for future creative platforms where public failure is part of the creative process.",Paper,Michael D.

This stands in contrast to the prevailing mainstream HCI paradigm, which we term the â€˜interactionâ€™ perspective.  The â€˜practice turnâ€™, as it has been dubbed in the social sciences, provides a conceptual frame to organize a variety of issues emerging in more recent HCI research. While this approach has been present in certain strands of HCI research for some time, it has not been articulated fully to date. In this paper, we provide a short account of the main tenets of this perspective, and then show how it can illuminate some of the recent debates within HCI. Our argument is one which does not seek to replace extant HCI theories, but rather to provide an alternative, complementary theoretical lens which may illuminate the present confusion among both researchers and practitioners as to the direction of HCI. The paper articulates a set of issues which can help direct HCI research programs, as well as highlighting the potential contribution of the HCI field to this practice approach itself, in terms of a more nuanced understanding of emerging practices.

While some evidence showed that grid and other visual embellishments improve memorability, experiments with contour lines suggest otherwise. In this work, we describe an evaluation framework to capture the impact of introducing visual references in node-link diagrams.

Our study reveals tangible benefits of contours when navigating large visualization spaces. ,"Summary of Changes \  \ 1.	As indicated in the meta-review we explicitly addressed the innate differences between the uniform grid and the data-dependent contour lines in the introduction section.  \  \ 2.	We included the references suggested by the reviewers in the related work section. The new references added are the following in the paper: [1, 9, 10, 18, 28].  \  \ 3.	We explained the contour line generation process in more detail on page 3, under Evaluation ->Techniques -> Contours.  \  \ 4.     As requested in the meta-review we expanded the discussion on various points as follows:  \         a) We added a paragraph discussing the metric selection to generate contours in a separate paragraph in the discussion section under Discussion -> Implications for Design -> Structuring the Space with Contour Lines. \         c) We added a paragraph discussing limited sample size of the study under  \ Discussion -> Limitations->Tasks and Sample Size section.   \         a) We re-structured the discussion section by addressing the granularity of visual references under a separate title of Discussion -> Limitations-> Granularity of the Visual Enrichments. \  \ 5.    We tightened the experiment reporting in order to make space for the above changes. We reported the effect size for the experiments only when significant.  \  \ We thank the reviewers for their thorough comments. We believe the manuscript, and the discussion section in particular, has considerably improved with these changes.  \ ",,Nathalie Henry Riche,Tobias Hollerer,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:13,pn847,A,Multi-Viewer Gesture-Based Interaction for Omni-Directional Video,Gustavo,Rovelo Ruiz,grovelo@dsic.upv.es,pn0847-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Gustavo Rovelo Ruiz, Davy Vanacken, Kris Luyten, Francisco Abad, Emilio Camahort","grovelo@dsic.upv.es, davy.vanacken@uhasselt.be, kris.luyten@uhasselt.be, fjabad@dsic.upv.es, camahort@dsic.upv.es",37501,Gustavo,,Rovelo Ruiz,grovelo@dsic.upv.es,Departamento de Sistemas InformÃ¡ticos y ComputaciÃ_n,Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia,Valencia,Valencia,Spain,Expertise Centre for Digital Media,Hasselt University - tUL - iMinds,Diepenbeek,,Belgium,12438,Davy,,Vanacken,davy.vanacken@uhasselt.be,Expertise Centre for Digital Media,Hasselt University - tUL - iMinds,Diepenbeek,,Belgium,,,,,,2807,Kris,,Luyten,kris.luyten@uhasselt.be,Expertise Centre for Digital Media,Hasselt University - tUL - iMinds,Diepenbeek,,Belgium,,,,,,37691,Francisco,,Abad,fjabad@dsic.upv.es,Instituto Universitario de AutomÃ¡tica e InformÃ¡tica Industrial,Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia,Valencia,,Spain,,,,,,37517,Emilio,,Camahort,camahort@dsic.upv.es,Instituto Universitario de AutomÃ¡tica e InformÃ¡tica Industrial,Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia,Valencia,Valencia,Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Omni-directional video (ODV) is a novel medium that offers viewers a 360Âº panoramic recording. This type of content will become more common within our living rooms in the near future, seeing that immersive displaying technologies such as 3D television are on the rise. However, little attention has been given to how to interact with ODV content. We present a gesture elicitation study in which we asked users to perform mid-air gestures that they consider to be appropriate for ODV interaction, both for individual as well as collocated settings. We are interested in the gesture variations and adaptations that come forth from individual and collocated usage. To this end, we gathered quantitative and qualitative data by means of observations, motion capture, questionnaires and interviews. This data resulted in a user-defined gesture set for ODV, alongside an in-depth analysis of the variation in gestures we observed during the study.",Paper,Gustavo Rovelo,gustavo.roveloruiz@uhasselt.be,"1.

However traditional news organisations are currently struggling to incorporate this new form of journalism into their existing organisational workflow. We present an analysis from 10 interviews with professional journalists and explore the current issues faced by professional journalists when searching for reliable and reputable local news sources as well as the perceived role of citizen journalists within a large news organisation.

In the context of designing digital peer support services for children who are considered vulnerable due to clinical and age-related aspects, there are several challenges that put critical requirements on a user-centered design process.  This paper reports on a new method for co-constructing child-personas that are tailored for developing health-promoting services where empirical data is restricted due to practical and ethical reasons. In particular, we are proposing to focus children design workshop sessions on salutogenesis, and complement this with a pathogenic perspective by interviewing healthcare professionals and parents. We also introduce the use of proxy personas, and redemption scenarios in the form of comicboards, both collaboratively constructed by children and designers through storytelling. By applying four progressive steps of data collection and analysis we arrive at authentic child-personas that can be used to design and develop health-promoting services for children in vulnerable life stages.",Paper,Pontus WÃ_rnestÃ¥l,pontus.warnestal@hh.se,"1.

We have based the revision on the rebuttal, and also addressed the post-rebuttal reviews. \  \ 1. Salutogenic design orientation and design practice \ We have clarified how we work with salutogenic and patogenic orientations as a theoretical framework to both structure and guide the design process (Section 2.1 last 10 rows) and how the salutogenic orientation allowed us to approach issues related to DPS that would probably not have arised in a strictly pathogenic orientation (Section 3.1, 2nd paragraph, row 7-8 and 3rd paragraph, rows 4-8), and vice versa (Section 3.2, 2nd paragraph, row 10 and 4th paragraph, rows 1-4). \  \ 2. Linking theory, findings, design practice, and outcomes \ All figures have been translated from Swedish to English. We have also included our second primary persona, â€œJuliaâ€ù (Figure 5), to show a more complete list of outcomes, and thereby show a clearer potential of the results. \  \ We have connected how our theoretical underpinnings in terms of salutogenic and pathogenic orientations are visible and merged in the design deliverables - i.e. the primary personas - and supported by our findings in the stakeholder interviews and design workshops data. In the translated personas, it is clearer which characteristics are derived from the stakeholder interviews (pathogenic, and disease-related aspects), and which parts of the persona are derived from the health-promoting aspects raised in the workshops with the children. This is elaborated on in Section 4 (6th paragraph). \  \ 3. Method \ We have removed the comparison with ""traditional"" UCD to clarify our process as a development of UCD techniques. (Section 3.2, beginning of 1st and 2nd paragraph.) \  \ We added a more detailed account of the Stakeholder roles (Section 3.2, 3rd paragraph, rows 1-11.) \  \ We have addressed the issue that it can be difficult for readers to understand some of the steps and activities in the design workshops by providing more details on what questions were used by the workshop facilitator for character construction, and how the activities relate to friendship and peer support. (Section 3.3.1, 3rd paragraph.) \  \ We have described and given examples of how we dealed with the childrenâ€™s ""naive"" vs more innovative design outcomes in design workshop 3 (Section 3.3.3, 1st paragraph, rows 6-7, 13-17), exemplified by the video chat app prototyped by the ten-year old girl in Figure 4. (Section 3.3.3, 2nd paragraph, rows 5-8.) \  \ As a final point, we have proof-read and corrected grammatical errors as helpfully pointed out in the post-rebuttal review. \  \ The sum of all above-mentioned revisions and added reflections on our methodology (as supported by additional findings) gives a clearer picture of the value of combining pathogenic and salutogenic orientations for child-persona co-construction in this domain. \  \  \ Kind regards, \ The Authors \ ","hci4d, cultures",Pontus WÃ_rnestÃ¥l,Jens Nygren,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/17/14 8:53,pn876,A,"RecoFit: Using a Wearable Sensor to Find, Recognize, and Count Repetitive Exercises",Dan,Morris,dan@microsoft.com,pn0876-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Dan Morris, T.

We introduce RecoFit, a system for automatically tracking repetitive exercises - such as weight training and calisthenics - via an arm-worn inertial sensor. Our goal is to provide real-time and post-workout feedback, with no user-specific training and no intervention during a workout. Toward this end, we address three challenges: (1) segmenting exercise from intermittent non-exercise periods, (2) recognizing which exercise is being performed, and (3) counting repetitions. We present cross-validation results on our training data and results from a study assessing the final system, totaling 114 participants over 146 sessions. We achieve precision and recall greater than 95% in identifying exercise periods, recognition of 99%, 98%, and 96% on circuits of 4, 7, and 13 exercises respectively, and counting that is accurate to Â±1 repetition 93% of the time. These results suggest that our approach enables a new category of fitness tracking devices. ",Paper,Dan Morris,dan@microsoft.com,"1. Amft, O. Adaptive activity spotting based on event rates.

[24], who similarly divide the problem into segmentation, recognition, and counting. They achieve 85% segmentation accuracy and 94% recognition accuracy (10 classes) using subject-independent training. We build on this work to improve robustness and accuracy, and we validate RecoFit at a larger scale. Like the present work, their approach to segmentation uses features based on the autocorrelation. However, [24] uses heuristic thresholds for segmentation; RecoFit uses learned segmentation, which we believe is essential to robustness and scalability. [24] identifies sensor placement variation as a key challenge. However, they donâ€™t address this algorithmically; RecoFit introduces dimensionality reduction to allow orientation-invariant analysis. RecoFit adds a deeper approach to repetition counting, addressing orientation-invariance and false peak rejection, which results in higher counting accuracy. Finally, [24] doesnâ€™t address real-time scenarios; we discuss all stages in the context of an online application, identify latency tradeoffs, and include results for online and offline recognition. \  \ ** \ Added discussion of intensive strength-training (discussion) (requested by reviewers) (page 9, first paragraph, subsection called â€œIntensive Strength-Training and Periodicity Breakdownâ€ù): \ One of our core intuitions is our use of self-similarity as a segmentation metric. However, self-similarity may break down in intensive strength-training scenarios. For this reason, more validation of intensive weightlifting is important future work. However, we highlight that we only rely on short-term periodicity: if the 10th repetition is different than the first, segmentation will not suffer, as long as itâ€™s some-what similar to the 9th. This addresses the bulk of cases weâ€™ve observed, where breakdown from fatigue is gradual. Furthermore, our aggregation step allows even a sudden shift in form (such as reversing grip) to be handled gracefully, so long as self-similarity resumes. \ Such scenarios also may yield exercises longer than our 5-second windows. This window is tailored to minimize latency, but one may use longer windows for circuits with slow exercises, or use a short window in the non-exercise state and a longer window when looking for the end of slow exercises.â€ù \  \ ** \ Added discussion of implications for generalized activity recognition (discussion) (requested by reviewers) (page 9, last paragraph, subsection called â€œImplication for Generalized Activity Recognitionâ€ù): \ We conclude our discussion by summarizing three key lessons derived from our work that we believe have implications for sensor-based activity recognition, even outside of the exercise space: \ (1) When analyzing periodic signals, the use of independent learned models for periodicity identification and activity recognition can increase robustness. \ (2) Dimensionality reduction can increase robustness to variation in device placement and behavioral orientation. \ (3) We provide specific novel features to capture self-similarity for human motion applications, relevant to fitness, pedometry, physical therapy, etc. \ ",games,Dan Morris,Scott Saponas,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 18:02,pn883,A,OneSpace: Shared Visual Scenes for Active Freeplay,Anthony,Tang,tonyt@ucalgary.ca,pn0883-paper.pdf,4,letter,"Arial Times_New_Roman Arial,Bold Times_New_Roman,Bold Times_New_Roman,Italic Helvetica,Bold",,"Maayan Cohen, Kody Dillman, Haley MacLeod, Anthony Tang, Seth Hunter","mc11om@student.ocadu.ca, kody.dillman@ucalgary.ca, haley.e.macleod@gmail.com, tonyt@ucalgary.ca, hunters@mit.edu",37561,Maayan,,Cohen,mc11om@student.ocadu.ca,,Ontario College of Art and Design,Toronto,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,37569,Kody,,Dillman,kody.dillman@ucalgary.ca,,University of Calgary,Calgary,Alberta,Canada,,,,,,37563,Haley,,MacLeod,haley.e.macleod@gmail.com,,University of Indiana,Bloomington,Indiana,United States,,,,,,5901,Anthony,,Tang,tonyt@ucalgary.ca,,University of Calgary,Calgary,Alberta,Canada,,,,,,15079,Seth,,Hunter,hunters@mit.edu,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,Massachusetts,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Children engage in free play for emotional, physical and social development; researchers have explored supporting free play between physically remote playmates using videoconferencing tools.

Instead, comments are separated from the tutorial content they reference and tend to be ordered according to post date. We propose and evaluate the TaggedComments system, a new approach to displaying comments that users post to online tutorials. Using tags supplied by commenters, TaggedComments seeks to enhance the role of user comments by 1) improving their visibility, 2) allowing users to personalize their use of the comments according to their particular information needs, and 3) providing direct access to potentially helpful comments from the tutorial content. A laboratory evaluation with 16 participants shows that, in comparison to the standard comment layout, TaggedComments significantly improves users' subjective impressions of comment utility when interacting with Photoshop tutorials.",Paper,Andrea Bunt,bunt@cs.umanitoba.ca,"1.

We present the findings of four participatory design sessions with immigrant women from the Caribbean to identify health and wellness challenges they faced and to conceptualize technologies to help them manage these issues. Stress, dietary challenges (specifically obesity), mental health, and domestic abuse, as identified by the women, form the focal themes for the design sessions. Their design approaches emphasized rebuilding the support structure, reducing stressors through entertainment and relaxation and encouraging positive gradational lifestyle changes. In conceiving health and wellness technologies for immigrant women, our work highlights opportunities for HCI to consider the role of others (and who benefits) and to reflect on the role of design and the underlying values and themes designs encompass. Finally, we emphasize how the technologies conceived by these women support rather than replace social solutions to the health and wellness challenges faced by these and other immigrant women.

We used location sharing systems to unpack the nature of discrepancies between a person's disclosure settings and contextual choices. We conducted an experience sampling study (N = 35) to examine various factors contributing to such divergence. We found that immediate feedback about disclosures without any ability to control the disclosures evoked feelings of oversharing. Moreover, deviation from specified settings did not always signal privacy violation; it was just as likely that settings prevented information disclosure considered permissible in situ. We suggest making feedback more actionable or delaying it sufficiently to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. Our findings also make the case for proactive techniques for detecting potential mismatches and recommending adjustments to disclosure settings, as well as selective control when sharing location with socially distant recipients and visiting atypical locations.",Paper,Sameer Patil,patil@uci.edu," \ WARNING: Reference 11 is very long.

In this paper, we present the results of the first comprehensive study on Finger-Count menus to investigate its usefulness as a viable option for 3D menu selection tasks. Our study compares 3D gesture-based finger counting (Finger Count menus) with two gesture-based menu selection techniques (Hand-n-Hold, Thumbs-Up), derived from existing motion-controlled video game menu selection strategies, as well as 3D Marking menus. We examined selection time, selection accuracy and user preference for all techniques. We also examined the impact of different spatial layouts for menu items and different menu depths. Our results indicate that Finger-Count menus are significantly faster than the other menu techniques we tested and are the most liked by participants. Additionally, we found that while Finger-Count menus and 3D Marking menus have similar selection accuracy, Finger-Count menus are almost twice as fast compared to 3D Marking menus.",Paper,Arun Kulshreshth,arunkul@knights.ucf.edu,"1.

We conducted a preliminary study to explore whether and if so, how, individuals in an economically distressed population with limited social capital use technologies to increase social capital and achieve socio-economic security. We contribute details about barriers affecting social capital (e.g., difficulties finding and making the right connections and an overall lack of trust within communities).

Our design context was Cognitive Testing on a Computer (C-TOC): a self-administered computerized test under development, intended to screen older adults for cognitive impairments. Using theory triangulation of cultural attitudes toward uncertainty, we designed two interfaces (one minimal and one rich) for one C-TOC subtest and hypothesized they would be culturally appropriate for older adult Caucasians and East Asians respectively. We ran an experiment with 36 participants to investigate cultural differences in performance, preference and anxiety. We found that Caucasians preferred the interface with minimal elements (i.e. those essential for the primary task) or had no preference.

The augmented view is typically implemented by rendering the video captured by the rear-facing camera directly onto the deviceâ€™s screen. This results in dual perspectivesâ€”the real world being captured from the deviceâ€™s perspective rather than the userâ€™s perspective (what an observer would see looking through a transparent glass pane). These differences manifest themselves in misaligned and/or incorrectly scaled transparency resulting in the dual-view problem. \ This paper presents two user studies comparing (a) device-perspective and (b) fixed Point-of-View (POV) user-perspective magic lenses to analyze the effect of the dual-view problem on the use of the surrounding visual context. The results confirm that the dual-view problem, a result of dual perspective, has a significant effect on the use of information from the surrounding visual context. The study also highlights that magnification and not the dual-view problem is the key factor explaining the correlation between magic lens size and the increased intensity of the magic lens type effect. From the results, we derive design guidelines for future magic lenses. \ ",Paper,Klen Copic Pucihar,klen.copic@gmail.com,"1. Artur, K.W., Booth, K.S., and Ware, C.

The summary of changes follows the rebuttal structure and +++highlights+++ which text segments of the final manuscript were modified. \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ =Generalisability to Real-world Scenarios= \ *Mapping Interactions* \ Our work addresses the general class of tabletop-sized AR workspaces using two types of tasks: (a) Cross-context interaction: where the user's hand will cross the borders of the lens and (b) View-merge interaction: where the user must merge the surrounding context and lens view.  \ There are many examples of where these interactions take place. For (a): AR supporting user sketching, e.g. transcribing digital instructions/routes to paper maps or reproducing a digital stencil on paper, and where tangible objects are brought into and out of the augmented view, e.g. AR chess with physical pieces; and for (b): Navigation and route-planning on augmented paper maps, e.g. where virtual routes/landmarks are augmented and the focus+context view still supports navigation decision making, and augmented magazine activities, e.g. the augmented view providing hints to a crossword puzzle. \  \ To clarify how our work translates into these real-world examples we will expand the scenario descriptions in the introduction.  \ ------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++The above reflects in modifications to Figure 1 and the text segments p.1 para.3 and p.2 para.2.+++ \  \  \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ *Mapping Tasks* \ Contrived tasks: We specifically chose to conduct a series of tightly constrained experiments in order to effectively evaluate cross-context interaction and view-merging. \  \ Cross-context interaction: was evaluated on a drag-and-drop task forcing users to cross the lens boundary, analogous to the examples described above in (a), where a user's hand commonly crosses the lens border during interaction. \ View-merge: was evaluated in a map navigation task where path following required decision making. Even though the task is artificial, this interaction pattern is analogous to the first AR use case of (b) above. [1] used a similar methodology and so it was deemed appropriate.  \  \ To justify the task design we will enhance the experimental approach section with these explanations and a add reference to [1]. \  \  [1] Oh and Hua, User evaluations on form factors of tangible magic lenses, ISMAR '06. \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++The above reflects in modifications to text segment p.4 para.9.+++ \  \  \  \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ *Restricted FOV* \ This work focusses on tabletop-sized workspaces. We agree that the restricted FOV is problematic when considering outdoor settings, but does not limit the applicability of our results in the evaluated context. We will discuss this in our limitations. \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++The above reflects in modifications to text segment p.9 para.8.+++ \  \  \  \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ *Generalization to Dynamic POV*  \ Yes, we believe our results will generalize from Fixed- to Dynamic-POV user-perspective rendering, as Dynamic-POV does not require users to maintain alignment above the screen (Fig 3e). We will comment on this generalizability in our discussion. \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++The above reflects in modifications to the text segment p.9 para.6.+++ \  \  \  \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ =Magnification Model= \ *Magnification as a Major Factor Limiting Context Merging* \ From Study A, we conclude that surrounding context use is predominantly affected by: (1) the existence of the dual-view problem; and (2) magnification. Study A detected: (1) a significant effect of lens type; (2) a strong interaction between lens type and size; and (3) a limited effect of lens size. Point (2) suggests these two factors are inter-related and we explain them with the magnification model. Which of these two are more important varies depending on the AR use case-an area we list as future work. \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++The above reflects in modifications to the text segment p.7 para.8.+++ \  \  \  \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ *Model Production*  \ The magnification model (Fig 5b) is derived from a theoretical analysis of ideal vs. camera-generated (virtual) transparency. Based on this theoretical model, and the screen size (w), FOV of the camera (alpha), distance to workspace (d'), and a variety of observer distances (d), we generated Fig. 5c to illustrate when magnification and minimization occurs for the devices used in our studies (minimising above 1, magnifying below 1). We then generated Fig 5d to summarise when the magnification advantage occurs. We will clarify these production steps in the 'Magnification Model' section. \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++The above reflects in modifications to the text segments: p.8 para.2, p.8 para.3, p.8 para.4 and p.8 para.5.+++ \  \  \  \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ *Generalization of Guideline Table* \ The design-guideline table can be generalized to any table-top sized AR workspace. To do this, the specific setup parameters are plugged into the model (Fig 5b), in order to produce the equivalent of Fig 5c. The magnification advantage (row 1, Fig 5d) is then derived (minimization provides an advantage, magnification does not), while the second criteria (row 2) is only lens-type dependent. This will be clarified by the changes made to the description of model production. \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++The above reflects in modifications to the text segment p.8 para.6.+++ \  \  \  \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ =Language= \ While R2 enjoyed reading the paper and R3 acknowledges the good writing style, we agree that the paper does require proof-reading. We have recruited a native speaker who is committed to spending the time to carefully proof-read the entire paper and help us to correct the language issues raised by the reviewers. \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++Modified segments: Whilst keeping the content of text intact, small text amendments were made through the manuscript to improve quality of presentation and correct language issues raised by the reviewers.+++ \  \  \  \  \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ =Additions= \ For the additional text, we plan to: remove p.2 par.7, p.3 par.4, and the quote in p.4 par.3; p.4 para.7, 8 and 9 will be summarized into one paragraph as a description is in [9]. \ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \ +++The above reflects in removal of all text segments listed above.

Below please find a summary of changes I have made (roughly in the order in which they appear in the paper). Please let me know if there are any additional changes or clarifications that are desired. \  \ 1. Changed the text in several locations to clarify our primary focus on damage management rather than reputation management in general. Also added explanation of how each of the categories is related to precipitating events and proactive versus reactive orientation. (1AC, 3AC) \ 2. Added text at two locations in the Related Work section to clarify distinction between this work and Soloveâ€™s work (1AC, R3) \ 3. Provided a fuller description of the data analysis process (1AC, 2AC) \ 4. Explained how the three primary categories (Necessary, Unpleasant, and Disempowering) emerged from the data analysis process (1AC, 2AC) \ 5. Clarified that the structure of the findings is based on the primary categories that emerged from the data analysis process (1AC, 2AC) \ 6. Anonymized company names throughout (2AC) \ 7. Added additional summary and interpretive text synthesizing quotes, and removed about 3/4 of a page of quotes (1AC, R1, R2) \ 8. Provided accompanying quotes for the first two subsections of the Disempowering section (and also addressed unsubstantiated examples by better explaining how findings are grounded in the field work as discussed above) (1AC, R1) \ 9. Rewrote discussion section, particularly to include more direct implications for the HCI Community (1AC, 2AC, R1, R2) \ 10. Added the 2ACâ€™s excellent suggestion to structure the proposed discussion within HCI to future work (the 2AC made some very thoughtful comments about this direction and suggested I might develop them in the discussion section; after careful consideration I didnâ€™t feel I had the space to do them justice so I mentioned this direction as future work) (2AC) \ 11. Made a number of other minor modifications and edits to improve readability and clarity",,Allison Woodruff,Allison Woodruff,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 17:51,pn941,A,"The Lonely Raccoon at the Ball:  Designing for Intimacy, Sociability, and Selfhood",Jeffrey,Bardzell,jbardzel@indiana.edu,pn0941-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Jeffrey Bardzell, Shaowen Bardzell, Guo Zhang, Tyler Pace","jbardzel@indiana.edu, selu@indiana.edu, guozhang@indiana.edu, tympace@indiana.edu",7080,Jeffrey,,Bardzell,jbardzel@indiana.edu,,Indiana University Bloomington,Bloomington,Indiana,United States,,,,,,7081,Shaowen,,Bardzell,selu@indiana.edu,,Indiana University Bloomington,Bloomington,Indiana,United States,,,,,,21199,Guo,,Zhang,guozhang@indiana.edu,,Indiana University Bloomington,Bloomington,Indiana,United States,,,,,,9125,Tyler,,Pace,tympace@indiana.edu,,Indiana University Bloomington,Bloomington,Indiana,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Designing for sociable systems requires, among other abilities, a sensitivity to the meanings, structures, and nuances of technology-mediated experiences that are simultaneously felt by users to be intimate and also social. Such a sensitivity is not easily acquired, and design researchers have recommended the use of social theories to guide designersâ€™ readings of technology-mediated social experiences. We use philosopher Michel Foucaultâ€™s theory of identity (and social power, discourse, sexuality, creativity, and style) known as â€œthe care of the self,â€ù as a scaffold with which to produce a sensitive interpretation of the intimacy (and ex-pert social creative) practices of adult users of the virtual world Second Life (SL). This reading sheds light on several skilled and creative intimacy practices in SL. It also offers a philosophically grounded hermeneutic strategy for designers interested in analyzing intimate experiences.",Paper,Jeffrey Bardzell,jbardzel@indiana.edu,"1.

Our results suggest that parents felt that this approach helped facilitate discussions with their children and made the education more enjoyable and approachable, and that children may have also learned from the interaction.

As computers become integral parts of our lives, we spend more time staring at computer monitor than ever before, sometimes with negative effects. One major concern is the increasing number of people suffering from Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). CVS is caused by extensive use of computers, and its symptoms include eye fatigue, frequent headaches, dry eyes, and blurred vision. It is possible to partially alleviate CVS if we can remind users to blink more often. We present a prototype system that uses a camera to monitor a user's blink rate, and when the user has not blinked in a while, the system triggers a blink stimulus. We investigated four different types of eye-blink stimulus: screen blurring, screen flashing, border flashing, and pop-up notifications. Users also rated each stimulus type in terms of effectiveness, intrusiveness, and satisfaction. Results from our user studies show that our stimuli are effective in increasing user blink rate with screen blurring being the best.",Paper,Yang Wang,ywang@ucdavis.edu,"1.

Designers have often associated limitations of their mid-air interactions with arm fatigue, but do not possess a quantitative method to assess and therefore mitigate it. In this paper we propose a novel metric, Consumed Endurance (CE), derived from the biomechanical structure of the upper arm and aimed at characterizing the gorilla-arm effect. We present a method to capture CE in a non-intrusive manner using an off-the-shelf camera-based skeleton tracking system, and demonstrate that CE correlates strongly with the Borg CR10 scale of perceived exertion. We show how designers can use CE as a complementary metric for evaluating existing and designing novel mid-air interactions, including tasks with repetitive input such as mid-air text-entry. Finally, we propose a series of guidelines for the design of fatigue-efficient mid-air interfaces.",Paper,Juan David Hincapie-Ramos,jdhr@cs.umanitoba.ca,"1.

In the following we describe how the points raised by the shepherd were addressed in our paper. \ We take the first two points out of order: \ 2. How have you broadened and clarified the expert/non-expert issues in this paper and address the R1 point that experts ""can go ahead and read error bars."" \ Several times (page 1,2,9, and 11 in the draft of 12/24) we point out that even experts who use statistics in their research have difficulty understanding confidence intervals. The common rule of thumbâ€”looking for confidence interval overlapâ€”doesnâ€™t actually do what experts think it does. We outsource the heavy lifting on this to Cumming [6,7] and Belia et al [3], whose titleâ€”â€œResearchers misunderstand confidence intervals and standard error barsâ€ùâ€” says it all.  \ Similarly, it is almost impossible to â€˜read error barsâ€™ for questions like ordering and sequencing. Figure 3, which illustrates the ranked list, is a great example.  We do not specifically criticize the notion of â€œreading the error barsâ€ù, but we do instead point out that users can read our visualization directly. We would be happy to add in an explicit comment to that effect.  \ As we briefly discuss in the â€œDiscussion & Future Workâ€ù section, we expect that our principles and similar visualization/interaction techniques would be very helpful in analysis using more complex visualizationsâ€”ones where reading the error bars may not be possible.  \  \ 1. The authors have argued that the audience are ""analysts familiar with confidence intervals and basic statistics"" which is why this is a relevant and representative test audience. While this reduced the score from one reviewer the authors need to describe how they have framed this paper specifically for this audience. \ 	As described in the previous answer, in several places in the paper we try to motivate the target audience by using the argument that even experts have problems fully understanding confidence intervals.  We think that this is a strong motivation for our work. We added an explicit comment in the first paragraph of section â€œThe Design of Sample-Based Visualizationsâ€ù that states that this target population guided our design. In several places in the paper, we have used the term â€œdata analystsâ€ù instead of â€œusersâ€ù to denote individuals of our target population, we believe that this emphasizes our target population throughout the paper. Finally, we improved the discussion of user population in the evaluation section.  \ In our study we used people with at least basic statistics training and experience in data analysis because these are our target audience. (As R1 notes, these techniques might also be useful for people who are not as familiar with statistics). Previous work, such as Belia et al, also examine researchers who use statistics in their regular work. A future study could try to explore the impact of our annotations in this field. \ We hope that our modifications help make this point more clearly.  \  \ 3. How have the issues of the analysis of data in this study raised by the 2AC been addressed  \ The 2AC raises several questions: \ Our choice of using CS students was addressed above, in our discussion of expert vs non-expert, and our target audience. \ We address more about the â€˜narrow scope of the studyâ€™ and the claim that â€œactual Analysis is shallowâ€ù in the next question. \  \ 4. How have the authors addressed that fact that the evaluation is shallow and lacks quantitative detail? \ We have modified the evaluation to first, discuss the qualitative results. We see these as the main contribution, as they help drive our future work and allow us to know that we are on the right track. We have broken out the accuracy chart by sample size to illustrate how accuracy changes with sample size. We could do the same with confidence, but have not in this draft. We have justified the use of the Kruskal-Wallis test (beginning of â€œQuantitative Resultsâ€ù section), and generally of using non-parametric tests.  \ We would be happy to discuss additional quantitative detail that would better illustrate our results. \ The 2AC also writes, "" My concern is if the evaluation as carried out can be trusted, and we can take confidence in the modest claims that the authors make in the paper. "" We sympathize with the ACâ€™s concern: in a small study like this, it is difficult to make quantitative claims. By emphasizing the qualitative results we sawâ€”both good and badâ€”we feel that we better illustrate the bounds of what we learned from the study.  \  \ 5. Clearly detail how you have addressed the typographical and presentational concerns of the reviewers. \ Weâ€™ve fixed numerous typos, including those pointed out by the reviewers.

Drawing on long-term multi-sited ethnographic research and active participation in DIY making, we provide insights into the social, material, and economic processes that undergird this transition from prototypes to products. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we show how DIY maker practice is illustrative of a broader â€œreturn toâ€ù and interest in physical materials. This has implications for HCI research that investigates questions of materiality. Second, we shed light on how hackerspaces and hardware start-ups are experimenting with new models of manufacturing and entrepreneurship. We argue that we have to take seriously these maker practices, not just as hobbyist or leisure practice, but as a professionalizing field functioning in parallel to research and industry labs. Finally, we end with reflections on the role of HCI researchers and designers as DIY making emerges as a site of HCI innovation. We argue that HCI is positioned to provide critical reflection, paired with a sensibility for materials, tools and design methods.",Paper,Silvia Lindtner,silvia.lindtner@gmail.com,"1. Anderson, C.

We present results from an interview study involving 22 older adults (age 71-92) to understand communication preferences and values related to social media. Seniors articulate many concerns with online social media, including the time required for legitimate participation, the loss of deeper communication, content irrelevance, and privacy. Additionally, older adults engage in social practices that could be supported by online social technologies, but they rarely use such tools. The theme of material social communications emerges from our data, and we examine this in context of online social media.

The interface helps users develop expertise, since the motor actions carried out as a novice rehearse the expert behavior.

Yet researchers have noted that its uptake has been limited by certain lacks of intellectual infrastructureâ€”theories, methodologies, canons and exemplars, and a community of practice. We argue that one way to create this infrastructure is to cultivate a community adept at readingâ€”that is, critically interpreting and making reasoned judgments aboutâ€”critical designs. We propose an approach to developing close readings of critical designs, which are both evidence-based and carefully reasoned. The approach highlights analytical units of analysis, the relevance of design languages and social norms, and the analytical contemplation of critical aspects of a design. It is intended to be relatively easy to learn, to try out, and to teach, in the hopes of inviting more members of the HCI community to engage in this practice. We exemplify the approach with readings of two critical designs and reflect on different ways that a design might serve a critical purpose or offer a critical argument about design, society, and the future. \ ",Paper,Jeffrey Bardzell,jbardzel@indiana.edu,"1.

Reworked the whole paper to make it clearer that its primary audience are competent designers and design researchers who lack a certain literacy understanding critical designs \  \ 2. Reworked the introduction in particular, as follows: \ -- Shortened the general problematization of CD in HCI and refocused it more explicitly around the problem of a lack of a community of practice (in HCI) for CD, a lack of curated lists of exemplars, categorizations, norms, etc.  \ -- Argued that all of the above would be improved if more in the community were able to critically read, interpret, and make defensible judgments about critical designs. \ -- Situated our contribution as follows: we offer a critical interpretive approach to support more people in HCI learning how to do this (and also teaching others how to do it) \ -- Introduced a critical design (Amisha Gadani's ""Porcupine Dress"" from her ""Defensive Dresses"" collection) and sketched out several different kinds of readings (e.g., as art, as a fashion item, as design proposal/argument) to demonstrate how different hermeneutic communities of practice can and will diversely read a design like this, ultimately to motivate the question: ""What sorts of categorizations, associations, questions, insights, norms, judgments, etc., should be part of a critical designerâ€™s hermeneutic toolkit?"" \ -- Drastically shortened the earlier section on ""epistemological underpinnings"" and so forth (per the reviewers), making room for much of the above \  \ 3. The middle section had only minimal revisions \ -- The section where we present the framework had fewer concerns from the reviewers and accordingly we revised it more lightly \ -- One criticism was that we said that a critical design was first some other kind of design (e.g., blood bag radio is a radio, drift table is a table), and a reviewer objected that that was too narrow. We clarified this in two ways: (1) we emphasized that a critical design is constructed out of one or more everyday designs (i.e., not just one); and (2) we emphasized that critical design is constructed out of one more everyday design languages (in other words, rather than saying that blood bag radio is a radio, we said that blood bag radio is partly constructed out of the design language of radios). We believe this is more precise than the earlier formulation and also avoids the over-simplified understanding that one of the reviewers inferred from the way we had written it earlier. \  \ 4. The discussion had some more significant revisions \ -- The Wii example was removed altogether \ -- The ""really critical designs"" section was removed altogether \ -- This left the reading of Blood Bag Radio as the Discussion, which we thought was good since it seemed to be everyone's favorite part of the paper. \ -- Accordingly we expanded our reading of Blood Bag Radio \ -- And we fleshed out the section at the very end contrasting Blood Bag Radio with Drift Table as a way of showing that designs can successfully critical in different ways. To that we added Porcupine Dress (as a way to help tie up the paper), and we also offered a list of some very different ways that a critical design can offer a critical design argument.  \  \ 5 Throughout the paper: \ -- We changed the term ""assessment"" to ""reading,"" ""critical interpretation,"" ""making judgments"" or left it alone as ""assessment"" to more precisely reflect the practice we were referring to \ -- Sought to unify the paper by ensuring that the discussion reflected the problems set forth in the introduction and that the approach presented in the middle really did in fact serve the purpose we said it would \ -- Added images (and secured permissions to do so) of two designs, to facilitate understanding (Blood Bag Radio by Dunne and Raby and Porcupine Dress by Amisha Gadani) \  \ As a result of all of this, we think that the paper is structurally much simpler, offers a far more straightforward argument than the submitted version, and does a much better job of talking about critical designs, rather than talking about talking about critical designs. We thank the ACs and the committee for taking a chance on this. Between the decision and this submission, we also consulted with a design expert in the field to help ensure that our revision strategy really addressed the issues and didn't merely band-aid over them. We feel much better about this version of the paper and hope that we have done justice to the reviews and guidance that we received.

Specifically, ""fat fingers"", a term referring to the fact that users' extremities physically obstruct their view of screen content and feedback, become particularly problematic. This paper presents a novel solution for this issue based on sensing touches to the perpendicular edges of a device featuring a front-mounted screen. The use of such offset contact points ensures that both a userâ€™s fingers and the device screen remain clearly in view throughout a targeting operation. The configuration also supports a range of novel interaction scenarios based on the touch, grip and grasp patterns it affords. To explore the viability of this concept, this paper describes EdgeTouch, a small (6 cm) hardware prototype instantiating this multi-touch functionality. User studies characterizing targeting performance, typical user grasps and exploring input affordances are presented. The results show that targets of 7.5-22.5 degrees in angular size are acquired in 1.25-1.75 seconds and with accuracy rates of 3%-18%, promising results considering the small form factor of the device. Furthermore, grasps made with between two and five fingers are robustly identifiable. Finally, we characterize the types of input users envisage performing with EdgeTouch, and report occurrence rates for key interactions such as taps, holds, strokes and multi-touch and compound input. The paper concludes with a discussion of the interaction scenarios enabled by offset sensing. ",Paper,Ian Oakley,ian.r.oakley@gmail.com,"1. Ashbrook, D. Lyons, K., and Starner, T. 2008.

We also studied if status composition of shopping companions played a role in this process. By analyzing about 1800 minutes of eye-tracking data, video footages, and web logs, we found that split screen encouraged more diverse product search, shared view enabled better coordination, and location cue was the least distracting.

We have addressed the comments in the paper as follows. \  \ 1. Address the difference between co-buyer and buyer-advisor and its link to the hypotheses (R2) \ We have revised the paper accordingly to address this comment (Page 3).  \ We would argue that people with different status in a co-shopping group would have different decision responsibilities and commitment. In a co-buyer dyad, both individuals have equal decision responsibility. Whereas in a buyer/advisor dyad, only the buyer makes decisions, and the advisor merely provides suggestions for the buyerâ€™s consideration. In a word, co-buyer and buyer/advisor dyads have different status composition, and thus differ in information contribution, knowledge influence, and responsibility distribution. This further leads to different requirements of coordination and consensus. In a status-heterogeneous group (buyer/advisor), information contribution and knowledge influence are not equal. While for group with equal status (co-buyers), both parties share the responsibility to establish the knowledge base for further information provision and discussion. This may result in discrepancy between the levels of mutual understanding achieved by members of different status. Thus, we proposed H4 from the perspective of status composition heterogeneity. \  \ 2. Incorporate more recent work on awareness systems (R2) \ We have revised the paper and added more relevant references accordingly (Page 3).  \ For example, we incorporated the suggested papers (Morris et al. 2008 on SearchTogether, Paul and Morris 2009 on CoSense, etc.) as well as other recent work, such as, co-browsing dynamic web pages (Lowet and Goergen, 2009) and visualizations influence on synchronous remote collaboration (Balakrishnan et al. 2008) among others. \  \ 3. Define â€œdistractionâ€ù and â€œdistraction by actionâ€ù (R2) \ We have revised the paper to make more elaboration on this point (Page 4).  \ We would argue that distraction refers to the divided attention caused by tasks unrelated to the subjectâ€™s primary goal (Baron 1986). In general, distraction can be caused by many types of external stimuli. In this paper, different co-navigation systems involve different levels of visual awareness. Although visual awareness can help establish visual common ground, it also leads to different levels of distraction if forced visual exposures of oneâ€™s partnersâ€™ actions interfere with oneâ€™s own information processing. As a result, group members may often step into one anotherâ€™s way, driving shopping partnersâ€™ attention away from tasks related to their primary goal (e.g. information processing), distractions and even interruptions may occur. Hence, we focused on distraction by action, which is defined as the distraction caused by shopping partnersâ€™ actions, such as scrolling, cursor movement, page switch, etc.  \ To measure how well co-shoppers can concentrate on their own task at hand in a given co-navigation mode, we counted the number of â€œdistraction by actionâ€ù by analyzing the eye-tracking data. \  \ 4. The affordances of different technologies and how they relate (R1) \ We have made more elaboration to explain each of the technologies and how they relate to each other (Page 2).  \ We argue that these tools adopt different mechanisms to support collaborative navigation. Location cue allows users to navigate separately in their own browsers with a small clickable visual location indicator, providing high autonomy in browsing but low synchronicity in awareness of each otherâ€™s actions; whereas shared view keeps collaborators on the same page all the time but sacrifices the ability to act on their own, leading to high synchronicity but low autonomy. Split screen is somewhat in the middle along both dimensions. It provides a personal screen and a reference screen to monitor the partnersâ€™ behaviors, which leads to higher synchronicity than location cue but lower synchronicity and higher autonomy than shared view. \  \ 5. The combination of hypotheses on products viewed, time on site and search scope (R1) \ We have revised the paper to clarify this point (Page 3). Specifically, time on site and number of products viewed are leading metrics widely applied by both researchers and practitioners for e-commerce sales. We combined products viewed, time on site and search scope into one hypothesis, as they are related to each other, and as a whole could imply a general view of how consumers interact with the website itself in co-shopping. \  \ 6. Explain the last two paragraphs of â€œSplit Screen Encourages More Separate Product Searchâ€ù (R3) \ We have revised the paper accordingly to clarify the last two paragraphs (Page 7).  \ These two paragraphs aimed to explain the different findings concerning subjective measurements and objective measurements. The objective results showed that split screen led to a bigger search scope than location cue, while the subjective results indicated no significant difference between the two.  \ We have revised and elaborated as follows: the actual search scope with location cue, compared to that with split screen, was constrained by the decreased readiness to exchange individual search results. However, the subjective results show no difference between these two conditions. It suggests that co-shoppers appreciated the search autonomy provided by location cue and split screen, and thus â€œperceivedâ€ù that both methods enabled wider search. In other words, the effect of â€œillusion of controlâ€ù may make users overestimate their search performance.  \  \ 7. Clarify hotel selection (R1), give a summary of results (R3) and improve figures (R1, R3) \ We have clarified how the hotels were selected (Page 5), provided a summary of the results at the end (Page 9) and improved the figures to make them clearer. \ Specifically, for hotel selection, the hotels used in the study are real hotels extracted from an existing hotel booking website (i.e. tripadvisor.com). We have also provided a summary of results (as shown in Table 1) in the revision. \  \ ",,Yanzhen Yue,Xiaojuan Ma,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 3:50,pn1034,A,Understanding Physical Activity through 3D Printed Material Artifacts,Rohit,Khot,rohit.a.khot@gmail.com,pn1034-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Rohit Ashok Khot, Larissa Hjorth, Florian 'Floyd' Mueller","rohit.a.khot@gmail.com, larissa.hjorth@rmit.edu.au, floyd@floydmueller.com",10580,Rohit,Ashok,Khot,rohit.a.khot@gmail.com,Exertion games lab,RMIT University,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia,,,,,,39159,Larissa,,Hjorth,larissa.hjorth@rmit.edu.au,,RMIT University,Melbourne,,Australia,,,,,,2060,Florian,'Floyd',Mueller,floyd@floydmueller.com,,RMIT University,Melbourne,,Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this paper, we advocate a novel approach of representing physical activity in the form of material artifacts. By designing such material representations, we aim to understand what these artifacts might offer in terms of reflecting upon physical activity. For example, what types of affect do material artifacts, representing onesâ€™ physical activity create for the user? In order to advance this understanding, we designed a system called SweatAtoms that transforms the physical activity data based on heart rate into 3D printed material artifacts. We conducted an â€œin the wild studyâ€ù by deploying our system in six households where participants were experiencing five different material representations of their physical activity for a period of two weeks each. We found that the material artifacts made participants more conscious about their involvement in physical activity and illustrated different levels of engagement with the artifacts. Along with reporting the gained insights from the deployments, we offer reflections on designing material representations for physical activity. We hope that our work will inspire designers to consider new possibilities afforded by digital fabrication to support userâ€™s experience with physical activity by utilizing interactive technologies at our disposal.",Paper,Rohit Ashok Khot,rohit.a.khot@gmail.com,"1.

Below we have listed the changes made, categorized by section and generally listed by occurrence in the paper. We have tried to address the reviewersâ€™ concerns to the best of our abilities and provided additional details where data and page limit allowed us to do. We thank the reviewers for their consideration. \  \ Abstract \ Editorial changes. \  \ Keywords \ Removed the word â€œmaterialityâ€ù \  \ Introduction \ As suggested by R4, we reframed the paper with low focus on materiality. Instead we stressed more on sensing technology and digital fabrication in the introduction.  It required shifting of paragraphs and addition of supporting lines.  \ R4 also suggested us to tone down the design goal, which we did by adding the following line to the end of introduction: â€œAlthough invoking behavioral change was of general interest to us, we focused primarily on eliciting richer reflections on physical activity and understanding the impact material artifacts, representing oneâ€™s physical activity, can have for a user.â€ù We also adjusted the lines: ""as a result, design and hci researchers are no considering the role of materiality"" and ""this argument is well supported"" as suggested by R4. \  \ Related work \ R2 wanted an elaboration on the connection between digital fabrication and physical activity, so we added a subsection â€œrethinking visualization of physical activityâ€ù at the end of related work section, explaining the connection between the two, which motivated this work. \  \ SweatAtoms: Proposed system \ R1 needed more details on the design process, so we revamped the design process to reflect hypothesis behind the choices. We added various aspects of digital fabrication and enhanced the aspects of physical activity and material representations that influenced our designs. It also includes information related to sustainability as asked by R2. We also updated Figure 1 and Table 1. \  \ SweatAtoms in Action: In the wild study \ No  changes \  \ Findings \ R1 desired explanation on encountered difficulty with 3D printing. In response, we detailed the setup instructions and the hands on demo we had with participants.  We also added more insights on the study in the findings sections. For example, we enhanced the lesson-learned subsection by adding content on novelty effect (R4) and engagement with material artifacts (R2). We merged â€œcontrasting digital with materialâ€ù and â€œ contrasting personalized with material rewardâ€ù subsections under one subsection titled â€œSignificance of personalized material artifactâ€ù. \  \ Discussion			 \ On suggestion from R4, we removed the first paragraph in the discussion section, which spoke on materiality.  We also removed the discussion on critical design and updated â€œMaterial artifacts for reflection and reminiscenceâ€ù section as requested by (R1). \  \ Conclusion \ Editorial changes (removed the word materiality). \  \ References \ References were updated accordingly.  \ ",games,Rohit Khot,Florian Mueller,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 21:32,pn1036,A,Unraveling Abstinence and Relapse: Smoking Cessation Reflected in Social Media,Elizabeth,Murnane,elm236@cornell.edu,pn1036-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Elizabeth L.

Combining automatic and crowdsourced techniques, we detect users trying to quit smoking and analyze tweet and network data from a sample of 653 individuals over a two-year window of quitting. Guided by theory and practice, we derive behavioral, social, and emotional measures to compare users who abstain and relapse. We also examine the cessation process, demonstrating that Twitter can help chronicle how some people go about quitting. Among other results, we show that those who fail in their smoking cessation are far heavier posters and use relatively less positive language, while those who succeed are more social in both network ties and in directed communication. We conclude with insights on how intelligent intervention systems can harness these signals to provide tailored behavior change support.",Paper,Elizabeth Murnane,elm236@cornell.edu,"1.

INTRODUCTION \  \ â€¢	We will re-write the introduction to clearly point out the contribution of our paper, which consists in: \ - (1) studying the human sensorimotor feasibilities to control a given number of pressure levels (i.e., light-strong resp. light-medium-strong) for three commonly used multi-touch gestures (i.e., pinch, scroll, stretch) without visual feedback \ - (2) referring implications from the study results (i.e., individual perception of pressure, good feasibility for two pressure levels, limited feasibility for three pressure levels) \ - (3) and proposing exemplary interaction concepts from the study results (i.e., content scrolling vs. window snapping, text indentation vs. text enumeration) \ â€¢	In particular, we will clarify that our feasibility study was deliberately performed without any feedback (on pressure intensity) or hints (whether the applied pressure was correctly recognized).  Referring to existing research in the field, we will point out that our goal was to explore the limits of pressure input without VF, in order to isolate the effect of using pressure as mode switching technique. \ â€¢	Furthermore, we will point out that our concept should be seen as alternative to other existing mode-switching techniques (like in Y. Li et al. 2005). Nevertheless, we believe that it might be easier to memorize common gestures overloaded with different pressure levels, as they are more similar to the original gestures (e.g. Pinching) compared to completely new gestures. Especially if the meaning of gestures is extended in a comprehensible way. \ â€¢	Along with these changes, we will add and discuss the following references: \ - GÃ¡bor BlaskÃ_, Steven Feiner, â€œSingle-Handed Interaction Techniques for Multiple Pressure-Sensitive Stripsâ€ù, CHI'04 (=> similar approach, but no study on user capabilities) \ - Y Li, K Hinckley, Z Guan, JA Landay, â€œExperimental analysis of mode switching techniques in pen-based user interfacesâ€ù, CHI'05 (=> alternative mode-switching techniques) \ - Wilson, G. A. (2013). â€œUsing pressure input and thermal feedback to broaden haptic interaction with mobile devicesâ€ù, Doctoral dissertation, University of Glasgow (=> extensive overview about human pressure sensing capabilities & pressure research in general). \ - Shi, K., Irani, P., Gustafson, S., & Subramanian, S. (2008). â€œPressureFish: a method to improve control of discrete pressure-based inputâ€ù (=> non-linear pressure thresholds). \ â€¢	The Abstract of the paper will be revised accordingly. \  \ 2.	CONCEPT \ We state more clearly that ForceDrag by Heo & Lee was an important basis for our work and that it is an extension of their single finger concept to multi-touch gestures. In contrast to their work, with our concept no explicit selection of the pressure level is needed. \  \ 3.	USER STUDY \ To provide a more clear overview of the feasibility study, we will re-structure the study chapter into three sections: \ - (1) Common study features (i.e., setup, hardware,â€_) \ - (2) Experiment 1: study design, results \ - (3) Experiment 2: study design, results \ Moreover, we will only present the study design & results in these sections, and discuss implications of the results within a newly created â€œDiscussionâ€ù section. \  \ â€ƒ \ 4.	DISCUSSION & LIMITATIONS \  \ â€¢	This new section will replace the â€œDesign recommendationsâ€ù section. \ â€¢	In that section we want to discuss the limitations and implications of our results more extensively and honest. \ â€¢	We will state clearly that accuracy for two pressure levels are OK, while three pressure levels are not suitable, as executing â€œmediumâ€ù pressure was problematic for most study participants. This could be due do different factors: On the one side that itâ€™s simply not possible with human sensorimotor skills or that currently available hardware cannot measure it exactly enough. \ â€¢	That we expect serious learning effects, like stated in [7]. Also playing the piano shows human capabilities to learn to apply different levels of pressure accurately. \ â€¢	That we observed relative dependencies between the trials, so if e.g. the user had three times the â€œHigh Pressureâ€ù condition, a â€œLow Pressureâ€ù condition was moderately higher as it initially was. \ â€¢	That our threshold algorithm might not be optimal: We took the averages from the training phase, but it might make sense to choose non-linear thresholds (like proposed in PressureFish). \  \ 5.	APPLICATIONS \  \ â€¢	Weâ€™ll state that three pressure levels without feedback is not suitable. Two possibilities: Either adding a feedback modality, which would give our concept of course much better accuracy rates, or designing interactions where two pressure levels are enough and make perfectly sense. \ â€¢	The application part itself will be shortened heavily by cutting down the explanations since figures, captions and descriptions are somehow redundant at the moment. \  \ 6.	CONCLUSION \  \ â€¢	Analogous to the introduction and discussion chapters, the conclusion will be revised. \  \ 7.	FUTURE WORK \ We will point out some interesting points to be covered in future work, which include:  \ â€¢	 investigating whether individual differences in pressure can be addressed in practical usage (referring to the per-user calibration limitation of the study) \ â€¢	conducting a similar feasibility study with different hardware (referring to possible hardware limitations) or a larger number of participants (referring to highly variable error rates) \ ",artIx,Christian Rendl,Patrick Greindl,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:33,pn1055,A,Predictors of Life Satisfaction based on Daily Activities from Mobile Sensor Data,Onur,YÃ_rÃ_ten,onur.yuruten@epfl.ch,pn1055-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Onur YÃ_rÃ_ten, Jiyong Zhang, Pearl Pu","onur.yuruten@epfl.ch, jiyong.zhang@epfl.ch, pearl.pu@epfl.ch",37690,Onur,,YÃ_rÃ_ten,onur.yuruten@epfl.ch,Human Computer Interaction Group,Swiss Federal Institue of Technology,Lausanne,,Switzerland,,,,,,33225,Jiyong,,Zhang,jiyong.zhang@epfl.ch,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LABORATORY,EPFL,Lausanne,,Switzerland,,,,,,5030,Pearl,,Pu,pearl.pu@epfl.ch,,EPFL,Lausanne,Vaud,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In recent years much research work has been dedicated to detecting user activity patterns \ from sensor data such as location, movement and proximity.

Input in this elevated layer has been previously used to modify the granularity of a 2D slider, navigate layers of a 3D body scan above a multitouch table and access vertically stacked menus. \ However, designing these interactions is challenging because the lack of haptic and direct visual feedback easily leads to input errors. For bare finger input, the user's fingers needs to reliably enter and stay inside the interactive layer, and engagement techniques such as midair clicking have to be disambiguated from leaving the layer. These issues have been addressed for interactions in which users operate other devices in midair, but there is little guidance for the design of bare finger input in this space. \  \ In this paper, we present the results of two user studies that inform the design of finger input above desktop devices. Our studies show that 2 cm is the minimum thickness of the above-surface volume that users can reliably remain within. We found that when accessing midair layers, users do not automatically move to the same height. To address this, we introduce a technique that dynamically determines the height at which the layer is placed, depending on the velocity profile of the user's initial finger movement into midair. Finally, we propose a technique that reliably distinguishes clicking from homing movements, based on the user's hand shape. We structure the presentation of our findings using Buxton's three-state input model, adding additional states and transitions for above-surface interactions.",Paper,Chat Wacharamanotham,chat@cs.rwth-aachen.de,"1.

The Metaphone machine collects the participantâ€™s bio-data, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Heart Rate (HR), creating a process of movement, painting and sound. The machine behaves in machine-like, aesthetically evocative ways: a shaft on two large wheels rotates on the floor, carrying paint that is dripped onto a large sheet of aquarelle paper on the floor according to bio-sensor data. A soundscape rhythmically follows the bio-sensor data, but also has its own machine-like sounds. Six commentators were invited to interact with the machine. They reported a strangely relaxing atmosphere induced by the machine.

We propose a Passhint authentication system (PHAS), where the users have to choose four images and create hints for each one of them in order to register a new password. During authentication, they have to recognize only the target images, which are displayed with their corresponding hints, among collections of 15 decoy images, in a four step process. A usability study was conducted with 40 subjects. They created 1 Mikon, 1 doodle, 1 art and 1 object password and then recalled each password after a period of two weeks (without any practice sessions). The results demonstrated that the memorability of multiple passwords in PHAS is better than in existing Graphical authentication systems (GASs). Although the registration time is high, authentication time for successful attempts is either equivalent to or less than the time reported for previous GASs. A guessability study conducted with the same subjects revealed that art passwords are the least guessable, followed by Mikon, doodle and objects in that order. The results strongly suggest the use of art passwords in PHAS, which would offer usable as well as secure authentication. The preliminary results indicate that PHAS has solved the memorability problem with multiple passwords. We propose two new features that could enhance the security offered by PHAS, but the usability of these features would need to be tested before they could be adopted in practice.

Currently, such research is still in its infancy and it usually involves collecting data in the laboratory, where during each experimental session one individual watches a video recording of a performance. We extend the experimental paradigm by simultaneously measuring Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) of a group of participants during a live performance. GSR data were synchronized with video footage of performers and audience. In conjunction with questionnaire data, this enabled us to identify a strongly correlated main group of participants, describe the nature of their theatre experience and map out a minute-by-minute unfolding of the performance in terms of psycho-physiological engagement. The benefits of our approach are twofold. It provides a robust and accurate mechanism for assessing a performance. Moreover, our infrastructure can enable, in the future, real-time feedback from remote audiences for online performances.",Note,CHEN WANG,cw@cwi.nl,"1. S. Bardzell, J. Bardzell, and T. Pace. 2009.

Multiple approaches have been adopted like filtering crowd workers through qualification tasks, and aggregating responses from multiple crowd workers to obtain consensus. We investigate here how improving the presentation of the task itself by using cognitively inspired features affects the performance of crowd workers. We illustrate this with a case-study for the task of extracting text from scanned images. We generated six task-presentation designs by modifying two parameters - visual saliency of the target fields and working memory requirements - and conducted experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and with an eye-tracker in the lab setting. Our results identify which task-design parameters (e.g. highlighting target fields) result in improved performance, and which ones do not (e.g. reducing the number of distractors). In conclusion, we claim that the use of cognitively inspired features for task design is a powerful technique for maximizing the performance of crowd workers.",Paper,Harini Alagarai Sampath,harini@research.iiit.ac.in,"1.

Contributes to understanding the impact of LBS at work and how technology can cause unanticipated consequences and undermine human relationships.,"Based upon reviewer feedback and our rebuttal, we have made the following alterations to our conditionally accepted paper.  \  \ IMAGE \ We have added a photograph of the iBus terminal on page 3. \  \ DESIGN IMPLICATIONS \ We have added a substantial section outlining the design implications of our work. In this we describe the ways future systems could support greater shared awareness between drivers and passengers (addressing R2â€™s concerns about the passenger perspective) but also between drivers and controllers. This could include feedback mechanisms to the controller, such as simple â€˜acknowledgementâ€™ signals to respond to controller requests. \  \ METHODOLOGY \ In response to our reviews we have made the following changes to this section: \ â€¢	We have expanded this section and given more contextual details of our ethnographic practice. \ â€¢	We note how observational data fed into subsequent interviews.  \  \ MISCELLENEOUS \ â€¢	R3 noted that according to the table, â€œPeterâ€ù had started working for London buses when he was 15. This is correct, he spent the first few years as a conductor before becoming a driver. We have clarified this in a footnote. \ â€¢	R3 also noted that â€œLesleyâ€ù was inconsistent when describing length of service as 6 weeks but saying she resigned after only 2/3 weeks. We contacted this participant for confirmation on this point and she revealed that in total it was 6 weeks and the 2/3 weeks didnâ€™t include her training and the time she actually ceased employment. We have changed the text to reflect her the total number of weeks in employment. \ â€¢	For clarity, we have changed 2/3 weeks to 2 or 3 weeks. \ â€¢	Where possible, we have replaced terms like â€œa small selection of driversâ€ù with actual numbers. \ â€¢	So our quotes donâ€™t read as â€˜anecdotalâ€™, we have, throughout the paper, supplemented quotes with observational points. \  \ DELETIONS  \ In making space for these changes, we have removed 2 paragraphs on p3 detailing the Oyster system, which was not central to our paper. We have also reduced the size of the Table 1 and carefully edited so as not to compromise the content of our paper. \   \ ",,Gary Pritchard,John Vines,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 11:03,pn1120,A,Brain Points: A Growth Mindset Incentive Structure Boosts Persistence in an Educational Game,Eleanor,O'Rourke,eorourke@cs.washington.edu,pn1120-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Eleanor O'Rourke, Kyla Haimovitz, Christy Ballweber, Carol Dweck, Zoran Popovic","eorourke@cs.washington.edu, kylah@stanford.edu, christy@cs.washington.edu, dweck@stanford.edu, zoran@cs.washington.edu",29720,Eleanor,,O'Rourke,eorourke@cs.washington.edu,Department of Computer Science & Engineering,University of Washington,Seattle,Washington,United States,,,,,,38533,Kyla,,Haimovitz,kylah@stanford.edu,Department of Psychology,Stanford University,Palo Alto,California,United States,,,,,,30440,Christy,,Ballweber,christy@cs.washington.edu,Department of Computer Science & Engineering,University of Washington,Seattle,Washington,United States,,,,,,38534,Carol,,Dweck,dweck@stanford.edu,Department of Psychology,Stanford University,Palo Alto,California,United States,,,,,,16067,Zoran,,Popovic,zoran@cs.washington.edu,Department of Computer Science & Engineering,University of Washington,Seattle,Washington,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is great interest in leveraging video games to improve student engagement and motivation. However, educational games are not uniformly effective, and little is known about how in-game rewards affect children's learning-related behavior. In this work, we argue that educational games can be improved by fundamentally changing their incentive structures to promote the growth mindset, or the belief that intelligence is malleable. We present ""brain points,"" a system that encourages the development of growth mindset behaviors by directly incentivizing effort, use of strategy, and incremental progress. Through a study of 15,000 children, we show that the ""brain points"" system encourages more low-performing students to persist in the educational game Refraction when compared to a control, and increases overall time played, strategy use, and perseverance after challenge.

Our results indicate that, contrary to prior work, a sequential work structure was more effective than a simultaneous work structure as the size of the group increased. A mediation analysis suggests that social processes such as territoriality partially accounts for these results.

Similar to human memory, crowd storage is ephemeral, which means that storage is temporary and the quality of the stored information degrades over time. Crowd storage may be preferred over storing information directly in the cloud, or when it is desirable for information to degrade inline with normal human memories. To explore and validate this idea, we created WeStore, a system that stores and then later retrieves digital files in the existing memories of crowd workers. WeStore does not store information directly, but rather encrypts the files using details of the existing memories elicited from individuals within the crowd as cryptographic keys. The fidelity of the retrieved information is tied to how well the crowd remembers the details of the memories they provided. We demonstrate that crowd storage is feasible using an existing crowd marketplace (Amazon Mechanical Turk), explore design considerations important for building systems that use crowd storage, and outline ideas for future research in this area.",Note,Jeffrey Bigham,jbigham@cs.cmu.edu,"1.

We describe the results from the first known study to investigate the long-term (12 weeks) use of exergames, designed in close collaboration with elderly users, for falls rehabilitation in the home. Our findings suggest that there is an untapped potential of exergames for home rehabilitation use, as our findings show that there was better adherence to exercise in participants who used the exergames, versus those who used standard care.

They also felt that these claims appeared too strong as a result of this. As agreed in the rebuttal, the results have been updated to include statistical analyses of the data on adherence, as well as the functional outcomes of mobility and balance. The graphs showing these results (Figures 5, 6 and 7) have been replaced with diagrams that reflect the updated results. The Discussion and Conclusion sections have also been modified to reflect the updated results, and to address the claims as suggested by the reviewers. \  \ Limitations of the study \ The reviewers commented that the limitations of the study were not acknowledged properly in the paper. A separate paragraph has been included, under the Discussion section, to highlight these limitations.  \  \ Design recommendations \ Some of the reviewers felt that the design recommendations did not match the study reported.

However, for people who are not proficient in that common language, delivering presentations fluently is very difficult. Simultaneous translation seems to be a solution, but besides its high cost, simultaneous translation undermines the nature of the presentation by substituting the real voice of the lecturer as well as his/her emotions. In this paper, we propose ""SmartVoice"", a presentation support system, which aims to overcome language barriers. By tracking the lip motion of the lecturer, SmartVoice controls the playback of the narration, which is a sound data prepared in advance or created automatically using a voice synthesizer. SmartVoice also controls the intonation of the sound based on the position and shape of the lecturer's mouth. As the lecturer can talk at his/her own pace with the voice automatically following, it appears as if he/she talks in his/her own voice. In our user evaluation, we confirmed that audiences find it difficult to distinguish between the narration generated by SmartVoice and that by a real voice. We also discuss the possibility of applying SmartVoice to fields other than multi-language presentation support, such as Automated Dialogue Replacement and language study.",Paper,Xiang Li,kular.ai@gmail.com,"1. openframeworks. http://www.openframeworks.cc/. \ 2. ofxFaceTracker. http://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker/ \ 3.

Two iterations of the design were tested, which resulted in higher quality student explanations constructed.

We would also clarify our aims in relation to other work (e.g., caves and other immersive environments â€“ as per R2).â€ù - Where appropriate, the Introduction and Background sections has been revised to make clear that our work concerns a distinct notion of â€œcollective inquiryâ€ù where the entire classroom of students is treated as the focus of interaction design. For the sake of simplicity and to maintain a coherent storyline, the instance of â€œcave-likeâ€ù to describe our projectâ€™s immersive simulation has been removed. \ 2. â€œFurther, we would expand our related work section to include projects concerning the cooperative use of displays and include more examples of physical-digital spaces for learning (R4)."" - Our background section on digitally augmented physical spaces for learning now includes detailed contributions from the literature in the area, including The Hunting of the Snark and Embedded Phenomena. Two new paragraphs on the use of large screens for advancing collaborative work have been added under the subsection â€œCapturing and Visualizing Student-Collected Dataâ€ù describing their use in single display groupware and multi-display environments. \ 3. â€œWith respect to the project and study description section, we would clarify the link between Zydeco and EvoRoom and better describe how the research was served by integration with Zydeco (R1).â€ù - The link between Zydeco and EvoRoom is now described more clearly in the project description section. Details of the specific features of Zydeco that closely aligned with the design goals for the second iteration were described in the ""Design Iteration"" section under a new heading: ""Incorporating Zydeco with EvoRoom."" \ 4. â€œWe would include more details of the co-design process, where the classroom teacher worked closely with researchers to develop a curriculum design (R3 & 4). We would clarify that the students who experienced EvoRoom were not part of the design process and the participants of trials 1 and 2 were different and separated by an academic year (R3).â€ù - Details were added to the Method section to clarify the co-design process and include additional details. We also clarified that the students who participated in the study had no prior experience with EvoRoom and that the participants of trials 1 and 2 were different \ 5. â€œWe would also clarify the analytic method and correct our reporting of inter-rater reliability (IRR). We have performed the IRR for both trials and achieved substantial agreement, and will report this.â€ù - Upon receiving the reviews, we re-assessed the IRR on a different (20%) set of the data and revised the results from the reassessment. The coding method was also clarified in the Method section. \ 6. â€œWith respect to our coding for student responses, in both trials 1 and 2 we used a coding scheme (to categorize observations as either potentially useful or not) that was published previously in CHI [1]. We will include this citation in our revision as well as a clear section on our analysis methods (R1 & 3).â€ù - The citation for the coding scheme used to categorize whether observations were potentially useful or not was included in the Method section. \ As per the previous issue, a paragraph in the Method section was dedicated to the description of our analysis methods. \ 7. â€œOur coding of â€œeverything looks sadâ€ù (as not potentially useful) did not mean to construe that students were off task, but that it was not scientifically productive, in terms of helping the students with their current inquiry activity â€“ this will be clarified in the revision (R3).â€ù - We opted to use a clearer example and have clarified that such observations were not scientifically productive. \ 8. More clearly articulating the contributions of this paper. - New paragraphs have been added to the Discussion section that identifies key findings of the paper (with respect to the research questions and design changes). The Conclusion section was further refined to describe larger take-home messages. \ 9. Better articulating how the first iterative phase informed the second. - The ""Design Iteration"" section was greatly modified to make clear what key design decisions leading from trial 1 to 2 were, with key design changes itemized. ""Trial 2 Results"" and the Discussion section were also  modified so that the design changes were discussed with respect to specific findings. \ 10. More explicitly discussing how this study addressed your research questions. - Two main headings in the Discussion section were linked directly to the two research questions. The subsection on Scaffolded Data Collection was meant to address RQ1 and the subsection entitled Interactions Supported by Emergent Visualizations was designed to answer RQ2. We added new paragraphs in each subsection that describe how the study addressed the relevant research questions. The lessons learned from this study were described in the conclusion section, and labeled in terms of the corresponding research question. \ 11. Connect the discussion with the CHI community and see if it can further inform future work.	- A paragraph was included in the Discussion section, under the header, ""Interactions Supported by Emergent Visualizations,"" that described how the current work informs CSCW work on large shared displays in multiple-device environments.  \ 12. Articulate the pros and cons of using such a high tech solution for this classroom activity.	- While there is actually no way to conduct this classroom activity without a high tech solution, we understand this request as asking us to consider the potential downsides of the technological approach. We have added to the discussion section, under a ""Limitations"" header, a statement about the limitations and liabilities of the EvoRoom experience that addresses the costs of the innovation.   \ Note: On January 12, 2014 I uploaded a version of the paper that is accessibility checked and the style of one of the graphs (figure 6) modified slightly.

Below we have listed the changes made, categorized by section in the rebuttal. We have tried to address the reviewersâ€™ concerns to the best of our abilities and have provided additional details where page limits allowed us to do. We thank the reviewers for their contributions. \  \  \ GUIDELINES: CAPTURING A WIDE RANGE OF GAMES YET SPECIFIC \  \ Reviewersâ€™ feedback:	 \ R1 asks (which was echoed by the AC) if some of the guidelines might be different for different player target groups, game types or game genres. \  \ Changes done: \ We added a section explaining the following: \ * We see our 10 guidelines only as a starting point, i.e. there could be more, going into more specific player target groups, game types and game genres. \ * We acknowledge that our current guidelines are trying to capture a range of games and players while providing concrete advice, i.e. we were aiming to be broad while specific. We mentioned how by proposing guidelines researchers must engage in a constant balancing act between being too specific and too general, a challenge expressed previously by work on interaction patterns (one of our inspirations [Borchers, J.O. A pattern approach to interaction design. AI & SOCIETY, 15 (4). (2001), 359-376]). \ * We added that engaging in this balancing act has distinct advantages and potential pitfalls for researchers (such as the guidelines being useful for a wide range of game ideas, yet not concrete enough for practitioners to use). \ * We explained how we aimed to hit the â€œsweet spotâ€ù between being too broad (and therefore not applicable and useful for practitioners) and too specific (and therefore resulting in guidance that practitioners do not read) based on our over 20 years of experience.  \  \ More specifically, we noted R1â€™s comment on how some of our guidelines, such as â€œSupport self-expressionâ€ù could benefit from mentioning goals from different game types, for example games that aim to train specific muscle groups. In response, we added this to our DOs and DONâ€™Ts. \  \ These amendments should clarify our objective for the guidelines to be useful for a wide range of games while also being specific enough and easily presentable in a practitioner-friendly format.  \  \ DETAILED METHOD \ Reviewersâ€™ feedback: \ R1 and R3 requested more detail about our method for generating the guidelines. \  \ Changes done: \ We added the following: \ * an articulation of the structure we engaged in for the two discussion rounds  \ * more details on how we arrived at the guidelines when we worked face-to-face and how we worked on the guidelines after that, in our respective labs, communicating over the internet . \  \ HEADINGS FOLLOWING GUIDELINES AND RELATED WORK \ Reviewersâ€™ feedback: \ R1 and R4 asked about the separation between â€œGuidelinesâ€ù, â€œDOs and DONâ€™Tsâ€ù and â€œAcademic reasoningâ€ù.  \  \ Changes done: \ We added transition statements between them, detailing their interrelationship, and replaced the term â€œAcademic reasoningâ€ù in order to better highlight the focus of the associated section on the underlying scientific basis behind each guideline. We also used this section to incorporate a discussion on the relationship of our work to the guidelines and taxonomies of movement-based games suggested by R1, R3. Furthermore, we added how this paperâ€™s guidelines relate to one of our own game taxonomies that we have previously published [Taxonomy of Exertion Games, OzCHIâ€™08].  \  \ MAKING SPACE TO PROVIDE MORE GAME DETAILS \ Reviewersâ€™ feedback: \ R1 and R2 suggested ways to make space. \  \ Changes done: \ In order to make space for the above amendments we trimmed down the section â€œFeedback from the expertsâ€ù as suggested by R1 and R2.  \  \ ",games,Florian Mueller,Katherine Isbister,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 8:49,pn1186,A,Evaluating the Effectiveness of Physical Shape-Change for In-pocket Mobile Device Notifications,Jason,Alexander,j.alexander@lancaster.ac.uk,pn1186-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Panteleimon Dimitriadis, Jason Alexander","dimitria@exchange.lancs.ac.uk, j.alexander@lancaster.ac.uk",37802,Panteleimon,,Dimitriadis,dimitria@exchange.lancs.ac.uk,,Lancaster University,Lancaster,,United Kingdom,,,,,,8697,Jason,,Alexander,j.alexander@lancaster.ac.uk,,Lancaster University,Lancaster,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Audio and vibrotactile output are the standard mechanisms mobile devices use to attract their ownerâ€™s attention. Yet in busy and noisy environments, or when the user is physically active, these channels sometimes fail. Recent work has explored the use of physical shape-change as an additional method for conveying notifications when the device is in-hand or viewable. However, we do not yet understand the effectiveness of physical shape-change as a method for communicating in-pocket notifications. This paper presents three robustly implemented, mobile-device sized shape-changing devices, and two user studies to evaluate their effectiveness at conveying notifications. The studies reveal that (1) different types and configurations of shape-change convey different levels of urgency and; (2) fast pulsing shape-changing notifications are missed less often and recognised more quickly than the standard slower vibration pulse rates of a mobile device.

During a 30 minute session, 24 participants performed several computerized tasks consisting of expressive writing, text transcription, and mouse clicking. During the stressful conditions, the large majority of the participants showed significantly increased typing pressure (>79% of the participants) and more contact with the surface of the mouse (75% of the participants).

Furthermore, we plan to add few more arrows on Figure 3 to clarify that each participant performed one of the four task orderings. \ - Mention that the 2-minute relaxing clip was selected and tested during a pilot study. \  \ Did the tasks elicit the intended emotions? \ - Remove the last sentence of the second paragraph (""Therefore, self-reported stress was"") \ - Increase font size of Figure 5. \  \ How is typing pressure affected by stress? \ - Emphasize that two of the participants showed less (although not significant) typing pressure during the transcription task. \ - Emphasize that one participant showed significantly less typing pressure during the expressive writing task. When analyzing the response of this participant during the stressed condition, s/he described a sad experience which may have caused the decreased of pressure. \ - Emphasize that the ordering effect only occurred in one of the four tasks orderings and that it similarly affected both stressed and relaxed conditions (decreasing the pressure values). Also, emphasize that even though there was an ordering effect, the differences between the two conditions were consistent with the differences of the other tasks orderings (more typing pressure during the stressed condition) \ - Mention that a longer relaxing clip longer could have addressed the ordering effect. \  \ How is mouse capacitance affected by stress? \ - Emphasize that all the participants showed significantly different readings between the two conditions. \ - Emphasize that even though a large majority of the participants (75%) showed significantly larger amount of contact with the mouse during the stressed condition, there were still 25% of participants who showed significantly less contact. This finding highlights that different people respond differently to stress and the importance of considering person-specific models to provide more accurate measurements. \ - Mention that there may be other underlying reasons explaining how an increase of stress may lead to an increase of pressure (e.g., change of body language, typing more aggressively) \ - Emphasize that the amount of interactions (typing velocity) was not significantly different between the two conditions. \  \ How much data is required to differentiate between the stressed and relaxed conditions? \ - Rename subsection to ""How much data is required to differentiate between stressed and relaxed conditions at any point in time?"" \ - Provide more information about the context of the question (development of a real-time classifier that needs to analyze information over certain periods of time to make predictions) \ - Emphasize that the x-axis of Figure 8 is normalized and, therefore, the curves of the two typing tasks are more different than they seem. \  \ Discussion \ - Emphasize the importance of individual differences when developing methods for automatic measurement of stress. Individual differences can be seen on the range of values of each participant (shown in Figure 6) and the different types of responses observed during the mouse clicking task. \ - Emphasize that 25% of the participants handled the mouse with less contact during the stressed condition. \  \ Conclusions \ - Emphasize that we found significant differences between the two conditions and that most of the participants showed increased typing pressure and mouse contact during our experiment. \  - Incorporate correction of review 2 (""we show THAT stress influences keystroke pressure"") \ ",IxSc,Javier Hernandez,Asta Roseway,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 15:00,pn1190,A,Wrigglo: Shape-Changing Peripheral for Interpersonal Mobile Communication,Joohee,Park,joohee.a.park@kaist.ac.kr,pn1190-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Joohee Park, Young-Woo Park, Tek-Jin Nam","joohee.a.park@kaist.ac.kr, pyw@kaist.ac.kr, tjnam@kaist.ac.kr",29330,Joohee,,Park,joohee.a.park@kaist.ac.kr,"CIDR Lab, Department of Industrial Design",KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology),Daejeon,,Republic of Korea,,,,,,12877,Young-Woo,,Park,pyw@kaist.ac.kr,"CIDR Lab, Department of Industrial Design",KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology),Daejeon,"Korea, Republic of","Korea, Republic of",,,,,,2587,Tek-Jin,,Nam,tjnam@kaist.ac.kr,"CIDR Lab, Department of Industrial Design",KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology),Daejeon,"Korea, Republic of","Korea, Republic of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We introduce Wrigglo, a shape-changing smart phone peripheral that allows pairs of users to share wriggling movements with one another.

We developed and prototyped a future scenario with highly variable, real-time electricity prices due to a grid that mainly relies on renewables. We designed and deployed an agent-based interactive system that enables users to effectively operate the washing machine in this scenario. The system is used to book timeslots of washing machine use so that the agent can help to minimize the cost of a wash by charging a battery at times when electricity is cheap. We carried out a deployment in 10 households in order to uncover the socio-technical challenges around integrating new technologies into everyday routines. The findings reveal tensions that arise when deploying a rationalistic system to manage contingently and socially organized domestic practices. We discuss the trade-offs between utility and convenience inherent in smart grid applications; and illustrate how certain design choices position applications along this spectrum. \ ",Paper,Enrico Costanza,ec@ecs.soton.ac.uk,"1.

Discusses design trade-offs between economic utility and user convenience.,"We thank the ACs for their useful comments to improve the paper. We have thoroughly revised our paper according to these over the past few weeks.  \  \ In addition to edits throughout the paper for typos, clarity of language, formatting and consistency of terminology coherent with what we promised in the rebuttal, we have addressed the ACsâ€™ 6 main points from the final reviews as follows: \  \ - to address point 1 (""Clarify the vision and premise from the very outset of the paper""), we edited the introduction (page 1) to introduce the Agent B system earlier, clarify the dynamic pricing scenario and our prototyping approach, clarify the aim to reveal tension that arise when deploying a rationalistic booking system into peopleâ€™s everyday lives, and emphasise the paperâ€™s contributions.  \  \ - to address point 2 (""Get to the data and analysis earlier in the paper..""), we shortened the scenario and system descriptions (pages 3 and 4), so that the study description starts on page 4 \  \ - to address point 3 (""Improve the depth and synthesis of analysis..""), we shortened and removed a number of the interviews quotes (pages 6 and 7) and added summary paragraphs at the end of each of the analysis subsections (also pages 6 and 7); we also added ""from automatic interaction logs"" to the ""system usage"" subsection heading (page 5), to clarify where the data reported on here comes from; and added the thematic analysis reference [4] \  \ - to address point 4 (""..laundry as a rational and planned activity, versus laundry as negotiated..""), we extended the discussion, particularly the subsection â€œThe Booking System as a Contingent Resourceâ€ù, including new references [22, 33, 34], and a new subsection ""Trading Utility for Convenience?"" at the end of the discussion (page 8) \  \ - to address point 5 (""backgrounding agency""), we reduced the subsection ""the hidden appearance of agency"" (was on page 9) to a single paragraph edited for clarity, and we renamed it to ""Orienting to the Agency of Agent B"". We followed the ACâ€™s suggestion and removed the section ""Putting agents in the infrastructure""  (used to be on page 9). \  \ - to address point 6 (""future designs"" and ""future directions"") we added the section ""design for smart grid applications"" (page 9); this section draws implications from the extended discussion on the tensions between everyday contingencies and the rationalistic booking system; thus offering design considerations that follow directly from our findings, and suggesting avenues for future HCI research. We also added a summarizing conclusion section.  \  \ Overall, we have made more edits than this changelog can reflect given the space limitations. Our goal was to focus the contribution of the paper, particularly engaging with the tensions raised by introducing a rationalistic booking system into the contingent organisation of domestic practices.  \ ",,Enrico Costanza,Joel Fischer,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:20,pn1193,A,Evaluation of Hear-Through Sound Localization,Georgios,Marentakis,marentakis@iem.at,pn1193-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Georgios Marentakis, Rudolfs Liepins","marentakis@iem.at, rudolf.liepins@student.kug.ac.at",4893,Georgios,,Marentakis,marentakis@iem.at,,Institute for Electronic Music and Acoustics,Graz,Steiermark,Austria,,,,,,40924,Rudolfs,,Liepins,rudolf.liepins@student.kug.ac.at,Institute for Electronic Music and Acoustics,KunstuniversitÃ_t Graz,Graz,Steiermark,Austria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Listening and interacting with audio commonly relies on using earphones which limit the ability of users to perceive their auditory environment. Earphone sets that integrate miniature microphones on their exterior can, however, be used to hear-through the auditory environment. We present an evaluation study in which sound localization when wearing such a hear-through system is compared to normal earphones, open headphones and unblocked ears. Although  localization performance is improved compared to open headphones, we find that it is compromised in comparison to listening without earphones because confusions of sound direction increase and localization judgment distributions are more dispersed and show a weaker correlation to the test directions. The implications of the results to human computer interaction and possible improvements to hear-through system design are discussed.",Note,Georgios Marentakis,marentakis@iem.at,"1.

To clarify this, we analyzed remote handshaking in which a robot hand that was attached just under a videoconferencing terminalâ€™s display moved according to the opening and closing motion of a conversation partnerâ€™s hand. Combining touch and video channels raises a question as to whether the partnerâ€™s action of touching a haptic device should be visible to the user. If it can be invisible, the action may be unnecessary, and a unilaterally controlled device may be enough to establish an effective touch channel. Our analysis revealed that the feeling of being close to the partner can be enhanced by mutual touch in which the partnerâ€™s action needs to occur but should be invisible.",Paper,Hideyuki Nakanishi,nakanishi@ams.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,"1.

Here we explain our changes based on the original and post-rebuttal reviews. In summary, we have changed all the parts we promised to do in rebuttal and edited some other parts to respond reviewersâ€™ post-rebuttal suggestions. \  \ 1. About the â€œblackboxâ€ù expression, in the â€œIntroduction and Backgroundâ€ù section, we removed our claim of our blackbox contribution. Instead, we explain that single-translation interface could hide some information like MTâ€™s internal mechanism and the flaws, and this hidden information might have value, which is suggested by studies like back-translation and Monotrans, and we want to explore ways to foreground this information with our idea of showing two outputs. Then we explain our idea to do so in the â€œIdeaâ€ù section. We hope this makes our contribution easier to follow. \  \ 2. We deleted potential overstating statement as 2nd AC pointed out, like â€œthe benefits outweighed the costsâ€ù. \ We also changed the size of Figure 1 to make it easier to read, and we explained more clearly the rating of usefulness for two-translation interface, in page 3 â€œPeople overall preferred two translationsâ€ù.  \  \ 3. We changed or removed some potential unsubstantiated claims like the sentences R2 pointed out. \  \ Changes we mentioned in rebuttal: \ 1. In the Results section, We added our measurement of Levenshtein string edit distance between parallel translations to show that two translations are not same, supporting that our idea of showing two translations might often be applicable. \  \ 2. We also added our finding that participantsâ€™ response time did not show significant difference, to support the lack of difference in self-reported workload on NASA TLX. \  \ 3.We emphasized this is a within subject study in the â€œUser Studyâ€ù section, defined CMC in the â€œIntroduction and Backgroundâ€ù and renumbered participant ids in the â€œResultâ€ù section.  \  \ 4. We also cited Monotrans, and Yamashitaâ€™s finding about asymmetries and inconsistencies in MT-aided communication. \  \ Thank you very much for your time reading this summary, we hope our revision makes this a better note.

MFR works with any force transducing technique or material, including force variable resistive inks, piezoelectric materials and capacitive force plates.

Our technique leverages temporal multiplexing of signals coming from a universal interdigitated electrode design, which is printed as a single conductive layer on a flexible substrate. It supports sensing of touch and proximity in-put, and moreover is capable of capturing several levels of pressure and flexing. We leverage recent developments in conductive inkjet printing as a way to prototype electrode patterns, and combine this with our hardware module for supporting the full range of sensing methods. As the tech-nique is low-cost and easy to implement, it is particularly well-suited for prototyping touch- and hover-based user interfaces, including curved and deformable ones.

In this paper we identify an underexplored design opportunity for building robotic teleoperation user interfaces following an evaluation of operator performance during a time-delayed robotic arm block-stacking task in twenty-two participants. More delay resulted in greater operator hesitation and a decreased ratio of active to inactive input. This ratio can serve as a useful proxy for measuring an operatorâ€™s ability to anticipate the outcome of their control inputs before receiving delayed visual feedback. High anticipatory input ratio (AIR) scores indicate times when robot operators enter commands before waiting for visual feedback. Low AIR scores highlight when operators must wait for visual feedback before continuing. We used this measurement to help us identify particular sub-tasks where operators would likely benefit from additional support.",Note,Jonathan Bidwell,bidwej@gatech.edu,"1. Imaida, Takashi, et al.

To reduce the need to collect this data by observing users, we introduce ARchitect, a system that uses the crowd to capture the dependency structure of the actions that make up activities.

Lower levels of self-esteem and using mediated communication were also associated with a greater likelihood of thinking that a conflict had a negative impact on the relationship. Yet, there was no evidence to suggest that individuals with lower levels of self-esteem exhibited more negative behaviors and perceptions in text-based communication than in FtF communication.

Photobox also provoked reflection on technology in and around the home. These findings suggest several opportunities, such as designing for anticipation, better supporting reflection on the past, and, more generally, expanding the slow technology research program within the HCI community.

Although the autoethnographic method can be disruptive for the researcher, it enables them to understand and empathize with the experiences mobile device users can face in difficult to access contexts.

In this paper, we start by identifying the factors that influence perceptions of social presence in human-agent interactions. By taking these factors into account and by following previously defined guidelines for building socially present artificial opponents, a case study was created in which a social robot plays the Risk board game against three human players. An experiment was performed to ascertain whether the agent created in this case study is perceived as socially present.

These friendsourced questions not only provide informational benefits, but also may reinforce social bonds. However, there is a limit to how much a person may want to friendsource.

These perceived social costs limit the potential benefits of friendsourcing. In this paper we explore the perceived social costs of friendsourcing on Twitter via a monetary choice.

Existing manual and automatic solutions that aim to save important emails from falling through the cracks have begun to address this problem, but may increase user workload, sacrifice efficiency, or fail to identify high value communications. In response, we developed MinEMail, an alert system that uses a text message (SMS) to remind and notify users of critical emails that may have been missed or forgotten. MinEMail provides an alert infrastructure as well as accurately labeling and predicting which emails are critical, and when and how they need to be addressed. To motivate our system, we also present an up-front study with 777 participants that aims to understand the state and limitations of email and SMS in enterprise. We conduct an experience sampling study of over 3000 emails in order to construct MinEMail's predictive models.

As auto-stereoscopy becomes available for the mass market we believe the design of S3D UIs for devices, for example, mobile phones, public displays, or car dashboards, will rapidly gain importance. A benefit of such UIs is that they can group and structure information in a way that makes them easily perceivable for the user. For example, important information can be shown in front of less important information. This paper identifies core requirements for designing S3D UIs and derives concrete guidelines. The requirements also serve as a basis for two depth layout tools we built with the aim to overcome limitations of traditional prototyping when sketching S3D UIs. We evaluated the tools with usability experts  \ and compared them to traditional paper prototyping. ",Paper,Nora Broy,broyn@in.tum.de,"1. Alper, B., HÂ¨ollerer, T., Kuchera-Morin, J., and Forbes, A.

We addressed these issues for the camera-ready version as follows: \  \ 1.) We clarified the linking between the literature study, the lab study and the prototyping tools in the following sections: ""Introduction"", in the last paragraph of  ""Layered 3D - Exploring Requirements"", and the first paragraph of ""Discussion"". \  \ 2.) For discussing our overall work we pulled out the ""Discussion"" sub-section from the â€œEvaluation"" section and made it a distinct section. We then, based on the evaluation, discussed how the participants accepted and applied the presented design principles while using the tools. In addition, we addressed limitations of the tools, as suggested by R3 (E.g. the MirrorBox restricts the depth layout to only three layers and makes the integration of 3D objects impossible.). \  \ 3.) We clarified the wording concerning 3D user interfaces in the Section ""Related Work"" and changed expressions like 3D user interface prototyping tool to depth layout prototyping tool (E.g. we changed the header of the sub-section ""Prototyping Tools"" to ""Depth Layout Tools for Prototyping S3D UIs"").  \  \ 4.) As the 2AC described, we complemented the subsection ""Implications"" of ""Structuring Information in S3D UIs"" by presenting our results in relation to other literature (Hick-Hyman, Treisman, Nakayama and Silverman). Moreover we added the sub-section ""Discussion and Limitations"" to address the contextualization and the limitations of our lab study. \  \ 5.) As R1 suggests, we restructured the abstract as well as the introduction to better match the paper's outline. \  \ 6.) We changed the title to ""FrameBox and MirrorBox:  \ Tools and Guidelines to Support Designers in Prototyping Interfaces for 3D Displays"" to reflect the contribution concerning the collected guidelines. \  \ 7.) We added the test statistics and degrees of freedom for the t-tests in Section ""Results"" of ""Structuring Information in S3D UIs"" as R2 suggested. \  \ 8.) We merged the sub-sections of the Section ""Workshops"" as R1 suggested. \  \ 9.)

Prior work has shown large potential of user-generated content on public displays. However, one of the problems with user-generated content on public displays is moderation as content may be explicit or troublesome for a particular location. In this work we explore the expectations of users with regard to content moderation on public displays. An online survey revealed that people not only think that display content should be moderated but also that a delay of up to 10 minutes is acceptable if display content is moderated. In a subsequent in the wild deployment we compared different moderation delays. We found that a moderation delay significantly decreases the number of user-generated posts while at the same time there is no significant effect on users' decision to repeatedly post on the display. \ ",Note,Florian Alt,florian.alt@ifi.lmu.de,"1.

Furthermore, we tried to better contrast our work to related literature in the introduction. \  \ (2) Delay times \ R1 asked about the choice for delay times. We clarified that, since prior work does not provide any hints on how to chose the delay times, we chose them to best reflect the userâ€™s expectations. In addition, based on R1s suggestion, we better explain the chosen delay times from study 2 to study 1. As suggested in the rebuttal we added the finding that the vast majority of users expect messages to appear instantly. Furthermore we clarified that delay times were NOT communicated to the users (R1) \  \ (3) Studies \ We clarified that >83% of the users think that moderation is important (as asked by R1). In addition we added an explanation about the mismatch in the number of posted and analysed posts (we considered consecutive posts made, e.g., to show a 4x3 tiled image on the screen as a single post). We furthermore added a brief explanation on why we believe that moderation delays do not affect people posting multiple times (as requested by R2). \  \ (4) Deployment \ We clarified that all posts appeared on all display simultaneously.  \  \ To fit in the changes we removed Figure 3, as suggested by R1.",,Miriam Greis,Florian Alt,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:49,pn1275,A,Let me catch this!

This allows viewers to use their mobile phone to retrieve, for example, information on the artist of the soundtrack currently playing or a discount coupon on the watch the main actor is wearing. We are particularly interested in the user experience of the interactive 3D cinema concept, and how different interactive elements and interaction techniques are perceived. We report on the development of a prototype application utilizing smart phones and on an evaluation in a cinema context with 20 participants. Results emphasize that designing for interactive cinema experiences should drive for holistic and positive user experiences. Interactive content should be tied together with the actual video content, but integrated into contexts where it does not conflict with the immersive experience with the movie.",Paper,Jonna HÃ_kkilÃ_,jonna.hakkila@gmail.com,"1.

To ensure the safety of indoor work, monitoring the operations of firefighting units is crucial. As in most countries, firefighters in Germany utilize radio sets to establish voice communication between indoor operating units and the supervisory structure outside. Based on findings from a long term ethnographic study in cooperation with different German fire brigades over a time span of more than 5 years we analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the current voice over radio communication tactics and techniques. We designed and evaluated a complementary text based communication device the EMERGENCY-MESSENGER to support the time critical work of indoor units working under harsh conditions, wearing Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA). We conducted 13 full scale training missions including extensive debriefings to design and evaluate the communication concept and the corresponding device.",Paper,Matthias Betz,matthias.betz@uni-siegen.de,"1.

We show that our school-based social fitness approach performed comparably in attitude and behavior change to more competitive or direct-comparison systems. These results expand the strategies available computer-supported fitness interventions. Our school-based social fitness approach to everyday adolescent health shows the potential for social computing systems to positively influence offline health behaviors in real-world settings.

A progressive comparison of the evolving user models towards the device target model, for analysing learning, involves determining the behavioral proximity between them. To quantify the gap between a user model and a target model, we introduce an edit distance metric for measuring their behavioral proximity using a bisimulation-based equivalence relation. We define edit distance to be the minimum number of edges and states with incident edges required to be deleted from and/or added to a user model to make it bisimilar to the target model. We propose an algorithm to compute edit distance between two models and employ the heuristic procedure on experimental data for computing edit distance between target and user models. The data is organised into two experiments depending on the device the user interacted with: (a) a simple device resembling a vending machine and (b) a close to real-world vehicle transmission model. The results validate our proposed metric as edit distance converges with progressive user learning, increases for erroneous learning, and remains unchanged indicating no learning.",Paper,Himanshu Zade,himanshu.zade@gmail.com,"1.

Based on the reviewersâ€™ comments, we believe the manuscript has greatly improved. Below we summarize our changes: \  \ - We added in more details on the study design and data cleaning including adding in more details on participant recruitment, the compensation, and making the distinction among â€œno responseâ€ù, â€œincomplete DINsâ€ù and â€œinvalid DINsâ€ù clearer. \ - Based on the reviewers feedback, in our discussion (p.8), we added in additional variables not originally captured in our study that may account for the systematic differences we found for who submits photos. We list out both social and psychological factors such as time availability, privacy concerns, financial motivations, and conscientiousness. We have also tweaked the bottom of paragraph 2 in the discussion to highlight that regardless of the explanatory variable, the systematic differences found in who submits photos will be important for researchers designing similar studies. In paragraph 3 of the discussion, we also addressed the novelty effect noted by R2. \ - As mentioned in our rebuttal, we agreed with the reviewers that we should more explicitly address the studyâ€™s limitations so that researchers can interpret the findings accordingly. We constructed a new paragraph (Paragraph in the conclusion), where we highlight some of these limitations (particularly the ones the Rs pointed out - e.g.,the focus of the primary study, the role of instructions and compensation, and potential differences in modes of data collection).   \  \ Other minor changes \ - We specified a â€˜dayâ€™ in the study is not 24 hours but a more limited period (9am-7pm). \ - Cited Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which is the terminology used within health/medicine.  \ - Added a graph showing the decays of photo and non-photo responses over time. \ - Fixed the problem of missing complete page numbers in several cited papers. \ - Fixed framing issues in the front end of the paper \  \ In order to make space for these additions, we condensed the literature review, and made minor cuts throughout.",,Zhen Yue,Kathy Baxter,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 17:02,pn1296,A,Just Awful Enough â€“ The Functional Dysfunction of the Something Awful Forums,Jessica,Pater,pater@gatech.edu,pn1296-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Jessica Pater, Yacin Nadji, Elizabeth Mynatt, Amy Bruckman","pater@gatech.edu, yacin@gatech.edu, mynatt@cc.gatech.edu, asb@cc.gatech.edu",26176,Jessica,,Pater,pater@gatech.edu,,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,Georgia,United States,,,,,,37899,Yacin,,Nadji,yacin@gatech.edu,,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,Georgia,United States,,,,,,1040,Elizabeth,,Mynatt,mynatt@cc.gatech.edu,,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,Georgia,United States,,,,,,1079,Amy,,Bruckman,asb@cc.gatech.edu,,Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta,Georgia,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Something Awful Forums (SAF) is an online community comprised of a loosely connected federation of forums, united in a distinctive brand of humor with a focus on the quality of member contributions.

We have made further small edits to this section in order to create space for the VSD description. \  \ We have also made minor edits throughout the discussion to help subtly frame KGM-DC workersâ€™ (our participantsâ€™) roles as guardians of an archive message rather than editors of archival content per se (again, to address the reviewersâ€™ comments and advice).  \  \ And finally weâ€™ve made small copy edits throughout the paper (including to a sub-section heading), to create space for adding Acknowledgements. \  \ Post-rebuttal, the 2AC had a â€˜minor suggestionâ€™ to elaborate a description about cited work on â€˜politically and ethically sensitive materialsâ€™. Addressing this comment, we considered adding further description to the literature review. However after making the copy edits above we had insufficient space for this. Given that the paper argument had been tightly written, we did not want to make further edits to create space for extending the literature review; we felt to do so could take away from the paperâ€™s persuasiveness. \ ",,David Kirk,Stuart Reeves,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 17:29,pn1330,A,â€œNarcoâ€ù Emotions: Affect and Desensitization in Social Media during the Mexican Drug War,Munmun,De Choudhury,munmun.dch@gmail.com,pn1330-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Munmun De Choudhury, Andres Monroy-Hernandez, Gloria Mark","munmund@microsoft.com, amh@microsoft.com, gmark@uci.edu",17433,Munmun,,De Choudhury,munmund@microsoft.com,,Microsoft Research,Redmond,Washington,United States,,,,,,14276,Andres,,Monroy-Hernandez,amh@microsoft.com,Fuse Labs,Microsoft,Redmond,Washington,United States,,,,,,1172,Gloria,,Mark,gmark@uci.edu,,"University of California, Irvine",Irvine,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Social media platforms have emerged as prominent information sharing ecosystems in the context of a variety of recent crises, ranging from mass emergencies, to wars and political conflicts. We study affective responses in social media and how they might indicate desensitization to violence experienced in communities embroiled in an armed conflict. Specifically, we examine relationships of three established affect measures: negative affect, activation, and dominance as observed on Twitter to a number of statistics on protracted violence in four major cities afflicted by the Mexican Drug War. During a two year period (Aug 2010-Dec 2012), while violence was on the rise in these regions, our findings show a decline in negative emotional expression as well as a rise in emotional arousal and dominance in Twitter posts: aspects known to be psychological markers of desensitization. We discuss the implications of our work for behavioral health, facilitating rehabilitation efforts in communities enmeshed in an acute and persistent urban warfare, and the impact on civic engagement.",Paper,Munmun De Choudhury,munmun.dch@gmail.com,"1.

We prototyped a wearable video chat experience and had pairs of friends and family members participate in â€˜shared geocachingâ€™ over distance. Our results show that video streaming works best for navigation tasks but is more challenging to use for fine-grained searching tasks. Video streaming also creates a very intimate experience with a remote partner, but this can lead to distraction from the â€˜real worldâ€™ and even safety concerns. Overall, privacy concerns with streaming from a public space were not typically an issue; however, people tended to rely on assumptions of what were acceptable. The implications are that designers should consider appropriate feedback, user disembodiment, and asymmetry when designing for parallel experiences.",Paper,Jason Procyk,jasonprocyk@gmail.com,"1.

Recent work has shown that viewers can perform such tasks effectively, for example to efficiently compare the maximums or means over ranges of data. However, this work also shows that such effectiveness depends on the designs of the displays. In this paper, we explore this relationship between aggregation task and visualization design to provide guidance on matching tasks with designs. We combine prior results from perceptual science and graphical perception to suggest a set of design variables that influence performance on various aggregate comparison tasks. We describe how choices in these variables can lead to designs that are matched to particular tasks. We use these variables to assess a set of eight different designs, predicting how they will support a set of six aggregate time series comparison tasks. A crowd-sourced evaluation confirms these predictions. These results not only provide evidence for how the specific visualizations support various tasks, but also suggest using the identified design variables as a tool for designing visualizations well suited for various types of tasks.",Paper,Danielle Albers,dalbers@cs.wisc.edu,"1.

These choices provide a mechanism for predicting task performance for time series visualization design. ,"Summary of Changes: \  \ In the revised document, we have addressed the reviewersâ€™ and shepherdâ€™s concerns (and fulfilled the promises in the rebuttal) as follows: \  \ * We agree that the submissionâ€™s framing of the work as a â€œframeworkâ€ù was a poor choice of wording. We have re-cast the work in less ambitous terms and completely removed the term â€œframeworkâ€ù from the paper. \     - The title has been changed to â€œTask-Driven Evaluation of  \       Aggregation in Time Series Visualization.â€ù \     - Throughout the paper, we have revised discussion of a â€œframeworkâ€ù  \       to instead discuss three design variables that provide predictive  \       insight into how different designs will support different types of  \       aggregate visualization tasks. In particular, the Introduction and  \       Informing Design Through Task (formerly Framework) sections have   \       been rewritten to reflect this focus. \  \ * Throughout the work, we clarify that our findings contribute to an understanding of visual aggregation, and better distinguish this work from prior literature in graphical perception.  \  \ * In the Background section, we have extended our discussion of existing task taxonomies in visualization and clarified our work as an example of mapping known tasks to design. We removed some less relevant citations (e.g. specific examples of designs, more examples from the perception literature) because they distracted from the central message and for space concerns. \  \ * The discussion of the encodings in the Hypotheses and Examples section have been revised. Further, the encodings figure (formerly Figure 3) has been revised to include descriptions of each encoding technique as subcaptions and is now colocated with the discussion of the encodings. \ We clarify that event striping represents a technique designed for a specific task in the Color-Based Encodings section and discuss that its performance suggests tradeoffs when designing for a specific task in the Discussion section.  \  \ * We clarify that no one design is likely to support all tasks and that our work can help inform the design of multiple views in the Discussion section. We further highlight that no single design is likely to support all tasks in the Conclusion section.  \  \ * The Limitations section has been revised to include a discussion of our focus on locate tasks and on static visualizations. The proposed discussion of the limitations of Mechanical Turk have been added to the Methods section. \  \ * We have corrected the reference font size and cleaned up the references to be more consistent. \  \ Specific changes to the paper are discussed below. In addition, we made a number of minor changes to the language not discussed here to improve the clarity and grammatical correctness of the writing.  \  \ --- \  \ Specific Revisions: \  \ Title: \ * Changed to â€œTask-Driven Evaluation of Aggregation in Time Series Visualizationâ€ù \  \ Abstract: \ * Revised to reflect refocusing away from framework and towards understanding aggregation \  \ Intro: \ * Removed old paragraph 1 \ * Revised remaining sections to focus away from a â€œframeworkâ€ù and more towards aggregation \  \ Background: \ * Paragraph 1:  \     -

We analyze novel data characterizing the goals of enterprise online communities, assessing the importance of goals for leaders, how goals influence member perceptions of community value, and how goals relate to success measures proposed in the literature. We find that most communities have multiple goals and common goals are learning, reuse of resources, collaboration, networking, influencing change, and innovation. Leaders and members agree that all of these goals are at least moderately important. However, leader and member perceptions of success on goals do not align with each other, or with commonly used behavioral success measures.

To summarize: (a) First, we contribute novel data and analysis to characterize leader and member goals for enterprise communities, derived from interviews and surveys. (b) Second, we contribute an improved understanding of how to measure community success against its goals \  \ (2) Clarified various aspects of the method: \ (a) The disparity between the number of leader vs. member interview participants (page 4). \ (b) Why we did not survey members on high-level goals (page 3) \ (c) Choice of rating vs. ranking goal importance in survey (page 4). \ (d) Expanding upon which behavioral metrics were used, why, and how they were analyzed (page 5, 9). \ (e) Added descriptive statistics for communities included in our data analyses (page 5). \  \ (3) Added â€œmember recommendationsâ€ù as a metric to our analyses for the final paper. \  \ (4) Fixed various minor writing issues. \  \ (5) Addressed all issues in the Accessibility Report to improve the accessibility of our paper. \  \ The R3 and R4 asked for an additional reference and a review of the communities of practice literature.

Q&A sites have emerged as an efficient way to address questions in various domains by leveraging crowd knowledge. However, they lack sufficient reliability to be the sole basis of customer service applications. We built a proof-of-concept mixed-initiative tool that helps a crowd-manager to decide if a question will get a satisfactory and timely answer by the crowd or if it should be redirected to a dedicated operator. A user experiment found that our tool reduced the participantsâ€™ cognitive load and improved their performance, in terms of their precision and recall.

Our experiment found that it reduced cognitive load and improved performance.,"We thank the reviewers for their clarification questions and constructive comments. Below the reviewers can find a summary of the changes done in the revision submitted. \  \ 1. Reviewerâ€™s point: â€œR2 concerns the motivation of introducing humans [...]  solving a real problem, or creating an artificial one for the sake of researchâ€ù  \ Changes made: \ see the changes reported below in response to point #3(b) below.  \  \ 2. Reviewerâ€™s point: â€œR2 argues that the machine learning section needs more detailed description [...]â€ù  \ Changes made:  \ We used label 1 as positive (Dark Side) and 0 as negative (Bright side): we replaced the labels 1 and 0 with the terms positive and negative and made it clearer in the paper that positive stands for prediction of the Dark Side: Dark is â€˜positiveâ€™ because it is the class we want to model. See the â€œAutomatic Predictionâ€ù section, first paragraph.  \  \ 3(a) Reviewerâ€™s point: The exclusion of three outliers and the equal-size division of subjects should be  justified (R2).  \ Changes made:  \ We clarified better the rationale and criteria for removing the three lowest-performing participants for some ANCOVA tests (H2, H3, Q2). We also clarified the rationale for splitting the sample in two groups 10 participants (to address Q1). See the last two paragraphs of â€œResults summaryâ€ù section. \  \  \ 3(b) Reviewerâ€™s point: The experiment datasets are from a Q&A site [...] in the real customer service application.  \ Changes made:  \ We included a clarification in the Discussion section of two tactics used to reduce this limitation. (â€œWe used two tactics to reduce this limitationâ€_â€ù). This addresses in part also point 1 above. \  \  \  \ 4. Reviewerâ€™s point: R4 concerns that the effect sizes observed seem so small [...].  \ Changes made: \ The reduction of perceived workload was evident across the full sample of 20 participants. This effect effect was more visible for the half sample of participants who performed better, who we believe are actually the most suitable in the role of â€œcrowd managerâ€ù.  \  \ We updated all the figures with bar charts, figures 4-8, to better render the effect size and make the figures more consistent with the ANCOVA tests. We replaced the old figures, which showed means and standard deviations, with new figures showing estimated marginal means (i.e., covariate-adjusted means) and standard error from the ANCOVA test. See figures 4-8. \  \ 5. Reviewerâ€™s point: Improve figure resolution and include new reference suggested.  \ Changes made: \ We fixed the figure resolution that are now at the original size. The suggested reference to the solution of Pal and colleagues was included in the â€œrelated workâ€ù section. \  \ 6. Formatting and accessibility problems  \ Changes made: \ The accessibility problems were resolved.  \ We added acknowledgment (p10) and copyright box (p1) \ ",,Gregorio Convertino,Massimo Zancanaro,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:12,pn1347,A,Global Connectivity and Multilinguals in the Twitter Network,Scott,Hale,scott.hale@oii.ox.ac.uk,pn1347-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,Scott A Hale,scott.hale@oii.ox.ac.uk,25457,Scott,A,Hale,scott.hale@oii.ox.ac.uk,,"Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford",Oxford,Oxon,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This article analyzes the global connectivity of the Twitter retweet and mentions network and the role of multilingual users engaging with content in multiple languages. The network is heavily structured by language with most mentions and retweets directed to users writing in the same language. Users writing in multiple languages are more active, authoring more tweets than monolingual users. These multilingual users play an important bridging role in the global connectivity of the network. The mean level of insularity from speakers in each language does not correlate straightforwardly with the size of the user base as predicted by previous research. Finally, the English language does play more of a bridging role than other languages, but the role played collectively by multilingual users across different languages is the largest bridging force in the network.",Paper,Scott A.

These users can act as bridges connecting users across languages. Suggestions for search and friend recommendation are discussed.,"Following the recommendations of the reviewers, the bulk of my changes concentrated on the introduction and discussion sections. These sections now focus on the motivations for the research and the design implications for search and follower/friend recommendation systems. I also summarized the main findings in the introduction. The introduction has not been split into multiple subsections due to space limitations, but I believe it now reads much more smoothly. \  \ I've tightened and clarified the language used throughout the paper. I replaced ""community"" with ""cluster"" throughout and define cluster with a citation to Newman (2004) where it is first used. I also replaced ""introversion"" with ""insularity"" and define this use in the ""Variations by language"" subsection. \  \ The remainder of the changes are mostly minor in line with the reviewers' comments. They include: \ *Removed definitions of multi/monolinguals from the abstract \ *Removed the ""multilingual users are no more likely to be retweeted or mentioned"" from the abstract \ *Added a footnote explaining the 20% or 2 tweet threshold (p. 3, footnote 3) \ *Reworded ""100 random shuffling"" and added a footnote with more details (page 4, footnote 6) \ *Corrected any unintentional cases where a paper was referred to only by number. \  \ There are good qualitative examples in the data to illustrate the points discussed. I really like the suggestion of the reviewer to include these within the paper, but simply could not fit them within the page limit. I will certainly use these in my presentation. \  \ I am very thankful for the reviewers' helpful comments.

We present a framework of how engagement and challenge in work relate to focus, boredom, and rote work. Overall, we find more focused attention than boredom in the workplace. Focus peaks mid-afternoon while boredom is highest in early afternoon. People are happiest doing rote work and most stressed doing focused work. On Mondays people are most bored but also most focused.

The table with these results has been removed. \ â€¢	We found most Bored reports occur on Mondays, instead of Tuesdays, with normalized scores, and have corrected the title to reflect this. \  \ Other changes: \  \ â€¢	Design implications from the results have been added in the discussion section. \ â€¢	Minor changes/edits that the reviewers identified have been incorporated. \ â€¢	We have done a thorough editing of the paper. \ ",IxSc,Gloria Mark,Shamsi Iqbal,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 3:40,pn1354,A,What Did Spot Hide?: A Question-Answering Game For Preschool Children,Anuj,Tewari,anuj.tewari17@gmail.com,pn1354-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Anuj Tewari, John Canny","anuj@eecs.berkeley.edu, jfc@cs.berkeley.edu",13088,Anuj,,Tewari,anuj@eecs.berkeley.edu,,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,California,United States,,GE Research,San Ramon,California,United States,3490,John,,Canny,jfc@cs.berkeley.edu,EECS Department,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,California,United States,Berkeley Institute of Design,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Early literacy is critical to child development, and determines a childâ€™s later educational and life opportunities. Moreover, preschool children are incessantly inquisitive, and will readily engage in question answering and asking activities if given the opportunity. We argue here that question asking/answering technologies can play a major role in early literacy. We describe the design and evaluation of a conversational agent called Spot, with the goal of engaging children in a 20-questions game. Towards this goal, we conducted a feasibility study to determine if childrenâ€™s questions are â€œon-topicâ€ù and suitable for ASR/dialogue systems. We evaluated Spotâ€™s performance at conducting a game of 20-questions against that of a human partner.",Paper,Anuj Tewari,anuj.tewari17@gmail.com,"1. Abu Shawar, B. and E.

The goal is to design video instruction to facilitate an experience that maximizes learning and satisfaction. A widely used but understudied design element in video instruction is the overlay of a small video of the instructor over lecture slides. We conducted an experiment with eye-tracking and recall tests to investigate how adding the instructor's face to video instruction affects information retention, visual attention, and affect. Participants strongly preferred instruction with the face and perceived it as more educational. They spent about 41% of time looking at the face and switched between the face and slide every 3.7 seconds. Consistent with prior work, no significant difference in short- and medium-term recall ability was found. Including the face in video instruction is encouraged based on learners' positive affective response. More fine-grained analytics combining eye-tracking with detailed learning assessment could shed light on the mechanisms by which the face aids or hinders learning.",Paper,RenÃ© F.

They are robust to illumination changes and make it easy to separate human bodies from the image background. Far-infrared radiation, however, has another characteristic that distinguishes thermal cameras from their RGB or depth counterparts, namely thermal reflection. Common surfaces reflect thermal radiation differently than visual light and can be perfect thermal mirrors. In this paper, we show that through thermal reflection, thermal cameras can sense the space beyond their direct field-of-view. A thermal camera can sense areas besides and even behind its field-of-view through thermal reflection. We investigate how thermal reflection can increase the interaction space of projected surfaces using camera-projection systems. We moreover discuss the reflection characteristics of common surfaces in our vicinity in both the visual and thermal radiation bands. Using a proof-of-concept prototype, we demonstrate the increased interaction space for hand-held camera-projection system. Furthermore, we depict a number of promising application examples that can benefit from the thermal reflection characteristics of surfaces. ",Paper,Niels Henze,niels.henze@vis.uni-stuttgart.de,"1.

Ubiquitous sensing systems have the potential to sense everyday behaviors and provide the objective feedback necessary for self-regulation of medication taking. We describe an unobtrusive sensing system consisting of a sensor-augmented pillbox and an ambient display that provides near real-time visual feedback about how well medications are being taken.  In contrast to other systems that focus on reminding before medication taking, our approach uses feedback after medication taking to allow the individual to develop their own routines through self-regulation. We evaluated this system in the homes of older adults in a 10-month deployment. Feedback helped improve the consistency of medication-taking behaviors as well as increased ratings of self-efficacy. However, the improved performance did not persist after the feedback display was removed, because individuals had integrated the feedback display into their routines to support their self-awareness, identify mistakes, guide the timing of medication taking, and provide a sense of security that they are taking their medications well. Finally, we reflect on design considerations for feedback systems to support the process of self-regulation of everyday behaviors.",Paper,Matthew L. Lee,matthew.lee@philips.com,"1. Bandura, A.

This paper describes an experiment in which users make decisions assisted by recommendations of a DSS in a fantasy baseball game. This experiment shows that the act of customizing a DSS can lead to biased decision making. I show that users who believe they have customized a DSS's recommendation algorithm are more likely to follow the recommendations regardless of their accuracy. I also show that this customization bias is the result of using a DSS to seek confirmatory information in a recommendation.,Paper,Jacob Solomon,solomo93@msu.edu,"1. http://lcs.mgh.harvard.edu/projects/dxplain.html. \ 2.

By analyzing the historical data of 5673 Wikia communities, we find that higher levels of membership overlap are positively associated with higher survival rates of online communities. Furthermore, we find that it is beneficial for young communities to have shared members who play a central role in other mature communities. Our contributions are two-fold. Theoretically, by examining the impact of membership overlap on the survival of online communities we identified an important mechanism underlying the success of online communities. Practically, our findings may guide community creators on how to effectively manage their members, and tool designers on how to support this task. ",Paper,Haiyi Zhu,haiyiz@cs.cmu.edu,"1. Baum, J.

But is this the same for non-native speakers? In this paper, we conduct an experiment where native English speakers (NS) and Japanese non-native English speakers (NNS) rate the emotional valence in text-only messages written by native English-speaking authors. They also annotate all emotional cues (words, symbols and emoticons) that affected their rating. Accuracy of NS and NNS ratings and annotations are calculated by comparing their average correlations with author ratings and annotations used as a gold standard. Our results conclude that NNS are significantly less accurate at detecting the emotional valence of messages, especially when the messages include highly negative words. Although NNS are as accurate as NS at detecting emotional cues, they are not able to make use of symbols (exclamation marks) and emoticons to detect the emotional valence of text-only messages.",Paper,Ari Hautasaari,hautis@gmail.com,"1.

We propose that designing interactions to behave like real-world systems of cause and effect makes them more intuitive. Using these basic principles avoids the limitations inherent to specific metaphors.  In three experiments, participants solved puzzles using variations of a novel graphical interface. Participants using interfaces that were consistent with the causal guidelines consistently solved the puzzle faster than participants using inconsistent interfaces. We also discuss common interactions already consistent with the causal guidelines as well as areas where the guidelines are likely to apply successfully. The causal order guidelines provide specific utility while also demonstrating how principles of causal psychology can be applied to help interface designers better convey the functionality of their interfaces.",Paper,Adam Darlow,adam.darlow@gmail.com,"1.

Workers gain new skills through interactive step-by-step tutorials and test their knowledge by improving real-world images submitted by requesters. In a series of three deployments spanning two years, we varied the design of our platform to enhance the learning experience and improve the quality of the crowd work. We tested our approach in the context of LevelUp for Photoshop, which teaches people how to do basic photograph improvement tasks using Adobe Photoshop. We found that by using our system workers gained new skills and produced high-quality edits for requested images, even if they had little prior experience editing images.

Our system incorporates a Kinect-based performance capture setup that allows animators to create 3D animations by tracking the motion of a rigid physical object and mapping it in realtime onto a virtual object. The animator then temporally annotates the best parts of each take. MotionMontage merges the annotated motions into a single composite montage using a combination of dynamic time warping and optimization of a Semi-Markov Conditional Random Field. Our system also supports the creation of layered animations in which multiple objects are moving at the same time. To aid the animator in coordinating the motions of the objects we provide spatial markers which indicate the positions of previously recorded objects at user-specified points in time. We perform a user study to evaluate the perceived quality of the montages created with our system and \ find that viewers (including both the original animators and new viewers) generally prefer the animation montage to any individual take.",Paper,Ankit Gupta,ankit@cs.washington.edu,"1.

The recent interest in gestural interaction techniques offers the possibility of recreating some of the noticeability of previous work actions, but little is known about the observability and identifiability of command gestures. To investigate these basic issues, we carried out a study that asked people to observe and identify different sizes and morphologies of gestures from different locations, while carrying out an attention-demanding primary task. We studied small (tablet sized), medium (monitor-sized), and large (full-arm) gestures. Our study showed that although size did have significant effects, as expected, even small gestures were highly noticeable (rates above 75%) and identifiable (rates above 69%). Our results provide empirical guidance about the ways that gesture size, morphology, and location affect observation, and show that gestural interaction has potential for improving group awareness in co-located environments.",Paper,Adrian Reetz,adrian.reetz@usask.ca,"1.

To assess this opportunity, we collected one month of phone sensor and sleep diary entries from 27 people who have a variety of sleep contexts. We used this data to construct models that detect sleep and wake states, daily sleep quality, and global sleep quality. Our system classifies sleep state with 93.06% accuracy, daily sleep quality with 83.97% accuracy, and overall sleep quality with 81.48% accuracy. Individual models performed better than generally trained models, where the individual models require 3 days of ground truth data and 3 weeks of ground truth data to perform well on detecting sleep and sleep quality, respectively.

However, what if unfinished ideas work? This CHI paper proposes a new design space we call non-finito products for the HCI community. This new design space is about intentionally unfinished products and how they foster new creations by end-users as they are actually used to help people solve their own problems. The central idea comes from the background of the growing complexity associated with IT advancement and from the new way of dealing with it, with the assistance of user creativity in the actual use of the products. This paper begins with the exploration of non-finito products as a new design space for the end-userâ€™s creativity in the personal user experience. We then defined and proposed non-finito products. We discussed three case studies that will help to understand the design space of non-finito products, and we framed the new design space by revealing the beneficial contexts and values. Finally, we suggested the implications of designing non-finito products. We believe that non-finito products will open a new design space in HCI, prompt a new means of replacing value-destroying complexity with value-creating version, and help to make a product better fit to user experience.",Paper,Jin-min Seok,jinminseok@gmail.com,"1.

In the first phase, users describe pain symptoms using BodyDiagrams and a text-only interface; in the second phase, medical professionals evaluate these descriptions.

The technique of creating maps from temporal data is known as isochronal cartography, and is a form of distortion for clarification. In an isochronal map, congestion expands areas, while ideal travel conditions make the map shrink in comparison to the actual distance scale of a traditional map. Although there have been many applications of this technique, detailed user studies of its efficacy remain scarce, and there are conflicting views on its practical value. To attempt to settle this issue, we utilized a user-centered design process to determine which features of isochronal cartography might be most usable in practice. We developed an interactive cartographic visualization system, Traffigram, that features a novel combination of efficient isochronal map algorithms and an interface designed to give map users a quick and seamless experience while preserving geospatial integrity and aesthetics. We validated our design choices with multiple usability studies. We present our results and discuss implications for design.",Paper,Sungsoo (Ray) Hong,rayhong@uw.edu,"1. Agrawala M., Li W.

Based on the reviewersâ€™ thoughtful comments, we have revised our paper from beginning to end and hope we have addressed the reviewersâ€™ issues both large and small. The following items represent important changes that we have made during the revision process: \  \ 1. We clarified the description of the contribution throughout, rewriting the abstract, introduction, and related sections to point out that not only is Traffigram a system based on a novel combination of an efficient mapping algorithm and a usable interface, but this paper presents one of the first usability studies of isochronal cartography and the first set of real-world design guidelines for this technique. \  \ 2. We completely rewrote the section on real-world applicability of the Traffigram application based on the reviewersâ€™ specific suggestions. We also addressed the issue of validity based on coastal contours that was raised by R1. \  \ 3. We provided more detail in the description of Traffigramâ€™s traffic anticipation model. \  \ 4. We clarified the following issues in the user research section.  \ - Participant recruiting process \ - Task order for comparative analysis (i.e. task 2 and task 4) \ - Cleaned up statistical representations (including P and N values) throughout the section \ - Completely rewrote the justification for the â€œPizza deliveryâ€ù task, based on R3â€™s comments. \ - Discussed implications of design alternatives in more detail. \ - Deleted the recommendation ""present every design variation"" and rewrote the entire section to more accurately represent the findings from the study. \  \ 5. We redesigned table1 and table2. Table 1 is now figure 9, and table 2 has been broken into new tables 1 and 2 based on R3â€™s suggestion. \  \ 6. We made each smaller modification that reviewers suggested, as well as adding improvements for readability and clarity throughout. \  \ We hope these changes make this submission acceptable to SIGCHI 2014.  \  \ Again, thank you very much. \  \ ",,Sungsoo (Ray) Hong,Cecilia Aragon,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:13,pn1448,A,EnergyBugs: Energy Harvesting Wearables for Children,Kimiko,Ryokai,kimiko@ischool.berkeley.edu,pn1448-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Kimiko Ryokai, Peiqi Su, Eungchan Kim, Bob Rollins","kimiko@ischool.berkeley.edu, ps2409@nyu.edu, 96chan@berkeley.edu, bob.rollins@parkdayschool.org",3175,Kimiko,,Ryokai,kimiko@ischool.berkeley.edu,School of Information,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,California,United States,,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge,Massachusetts,United States,38016,Peiqi,,Su,ps2409@nyu.edu,Interactive Telecommunications Program,New York University,New York City,New York,United States,,,,,,38017,Eungchan,,Kim,96chan@berkeley.edu,School of Information,"University of California, Berkeley",Berkeley,California,United States,,,,,,38018,Bob,,Rollins,bob.rollins@parkdayschool.org,,Park Day School,Oakland,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EnergyBugs are energy harvesting wearables with features that invite children to move their bodies to generate tiny, yet usable amounts of electricity.

EnergyBugs therefore turn the electrical energy into a tangible object that children can manipulate and think with. Two studies of EnergyBugs with 34 elementary school children have revealed that children carefully observed and negotiated the use of personally harvested energy with their classmates, as well as developed emotional connections to energy.

We think that the vocabulary of gestures we discovered would be useful for designers creating new musical touch-screen interfaces or for musicians composing with them.  We make it clear that by discovering new gestures we are addressing limitations of mainstream music apps which mostly use ""virtual keyboard"" paradigms.  \  \ In the second paragraph of the Introduction we clarify that the gestures that emerged in our research are quite different to those already in the literature and have added a reference [12] (Wobbrock et al) for comparison. Our gestures are generally two handed and contain many touches over a number of seconds to create sustained musical gestures. \  \ Similar changes were made in the second and fourth paragraphs of the conclusion where we suggest future uses for our research in developing more expressive musical apps, composing music with current apps or training other musicians and students. We state that our research shows that expressive gestures can be used to expand the power of musical touch-screen apps and create compelling performances. \  \ In the first paragraph of ""Designing Tablet Instruments"", we have added that although many tablet computers might be suitable for developing musical apps we chose the iPad due to its widespread adoption and established computer music development frameworks. \  \ To avoid confusion about the duration of interviews and rehearsals in the data corpus we have used #H#M#S notation in Table 1 as suggested by ISO standards rather than #:#:#.

We report on the online communications from all the coastal fire and police departments within a 100 mile radius of Hurricane Sandyâ€™s US landfall. Across four types of online communication media, we collected data from 840 fire and police departments. Findings indicate that few departments used these online channels in their Sandy response efforts, and that communications differed between fire and police departments and across media type. However, among the highly engaged departments, there is evidence that they bend and adapt policies about what constitutes appropriate public communication in the face of emergency demands; therefore, we propose that flexibility is important in considering future emergency online communication policy.

As we reread the paper alongside reviewer feedback, we saw that weakness in the Discussion (all reviewersâ€™ primary concern) could be traced back to earlier analytical and structural issues in the middle of the paper. Our changes follow the claims we made in our rebuttal document, and so are restated and elaborated here. \  \ In correcting the paper, we made many revision passes. We redid some analyses. With the middle analytical material better presented and more extensively discussed, we reworked the last section of the paper so that it is more pointed and tied to the data. Here we describe 1) the rework of the problematic analysis and 2) a summative outline of how that affected each section of the paper, including the better articulated results. \  \ MAJOR CHANGE THAT SNAPPED THINGS INTO PLACE: The Discussionâ€™s weakness largely stemmed from how we presented the results section about online engagement in the middle of the paper. Though our data coding was extensive, the collapsed â€œengagementâ€ù score obscured meaningful interpretation, as reviewers also observed (R2, R3 and R4). With distance, we could see it as we think you did---our readers hoped that the Discussion would resolve some undone analytical interpretation. We have unpacked the engagement score, which opened up the ability to discuss its meaning there. \  \ THE â€œENGAGEMENT SCOREâ€ù REWORK: We discarded the overall engagement score and revisited the 5-point activity score used to originally code for engagement. We carefully combined some categories to simplify distinctions between levels of use. Our new coding scheme includes 3 levels of engagement: INACTIVE (no or low use), NON-SANDY ACTIVE (had accounts but not used for Sandy), and SANDY ACTIVE (accounts used for Sandy). This simplification allowed us to restructure the Online Engagement section to present better visualizations of use across departments and across media. We present those new results and the resulting changes below. \  \ INTRODUCTION: No Changes \  \ STUDY SITE AND DATA COLLECTION: We describe the new simplified coding scheme. \  \ QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTIONS OF USE: This is the same, except we improved the discussion about websites, clarifying that they were used primarily to locate information about other online presence, and clearly treat it as such over the remainder of the paper. It is hard to know if some Sandy information from websites had been deleted and when, and so we separated that from the subsequent engagement analysis. \  \ ONLINE ENGAGEMENT: The section now begins by describing levels of engagement across online type. Results show that Facebook had the highest level of Sandy engagement (25%), followed by Twitter (7%), then Nixle (4%). Next, we describe levels of engagement by department. Based on the highest level of engagement they reached, departments are categorized as Inactive (46%), Non-Sandy Active (25%), or Sandy Active (29%). Within the Active categories we report how many media types each department used (1-3) in each engagement category type: Non-Sandy Active (used 1: 88%, used 2: 11%, used all 3: 1%) & Sandy Active (used 1:78%, used 2:19%,  used all 3: 3%). Results indicate that of those who were Sandy-Active, the majority (78%) only used 1 medium. Discussion then shifts to describing each engagement category and the reasons for different levels of use (such as lack of time & resources), as well as possible reasons for variability within each category. This reworked section adds strength and clarity to the analysis and overall offerings. It better motivates the transition into the next section. \  \ HIGH-ENGAGEMENT IS A SITUATED PRACTICE: Shortened & simplified the intro \  \ DISCUSSION (now an extended â€œCONCLUSIONâ€ù): Because we now have lengthier discussion closer to the data reporting, we reconfigured this section into an extended Conclusion. We begin by summarizing analyses. Next we now have a short discussion of implications for procedures & policy, followed by a discussion around how online communications provide a sense of transparency to emergency service work, as well as greater public accountability. We then add a new subsection around design implications from this research and future work, which specifically addresses concerns from R3 & R4. This discussion includes recommendations for making social media streams more â€œlistenableâ€ù for on-the-ground emergency managers, as well as more trackable to help better organize Q&A on the fly. These become researchable design propositions that we think are important for the crisis informatics community to take up. Discussion around future work includes insight about the relationship between a departmentâ€™s desire to communicate online (by virtue of establishing accounts and audience following during non-disaster times) and their (in)ability to act on those relationships when personnel resources become taxed during disaster. This is supported by unreported data in other studies of practitioners, and their deep concerns about creating versus maintaining a following when times are the worst. \  \ Throughout this concluding section we made efforts to ensure that our claims were supported by the data in the paper (R2) and that the discussion reflects a more balanced reporting of the data, instead of focusing  just on the activities of the highly engaged departments. \  \ OTHER ISSUES ADDRESSED: Reviewers noted several descriptive issues throughout the paperâ€”which we have addressed in our revisionâ€”where typos appeared (e.g. â€œhow and howâ€ù instead of â€œhow and whyâ€ù), the text was confusing (e.g. our  â€ùcomparison of how often officials replied directly to posts on Facebook vs. Twitterâ€ù), or terms were not clear (e.g. use of the terms â€œbulletin boardâ€ù and â€œpostsâ€ù).  R3 would like to see the role of different fire and police department staff in public outreach expanded upon. However, our approach in this study was to report on the â€œpublic communicationsâ€ù of these departments; these communications appear to members of the public as communications from the department as a single entity because no distinction is made (or given) as to who sent the communication within the departmentâ€™s organization. We feel this suggestion would complicate reporting and analysis, as well as confuse the reader. Further, the topic of who actually handles public communications across online media within fire and police departments requires study of its own, as it often varies by department. Therefore, we feel that implementation of this suggestion is beyond the scope of the paper and would be best addressed in an expanded journal article or as future research. \  \ R3 pointed to several limitations of the data collected in the study. We describe these limitations throughout the revised paper (mostly close to the relevant data reporting) and we also offer areas of research that need further investigation. \  \ We again thank you for your attention and advice and we hope you find the changes we have made satisfactory!  \  \ Amanda L.

In an experiment, pairs of remote individuals played the role of crime analysts solving a set of serial killer crimes with both partners having some, but not all, relevant clues.

Tolles: \  \ 1. Updated the license \ 2. Verified with Susan R. Fussell. It stays with R. \ 3. Non-Justified the Section head \ 4. Fixed the widow line on Page 6 by adjusting one of the paragraphs before. \  \ Thanks. \  \ Comments for AC \ --------- \  \ These changes have been accepted by our shepherd. The Shepherd said that we did a good job integrating more literature into the paper, situating our experiment in the context of other similar work. She also like thee explanation of the distinction between choosing explicitly to share information with one's collaborator, vs. the implicit sharing that took place in our experiment. No further revisions were necessary. . \  \ Please find below the outline of the changes we made based on the suggestions made by you and other reviewers: \  \ 1. The related work section must be revised to include a review of literature similar to Convertino et al. (2011); Reviewer 6 provides some additional suggestions of other papers in this area.  \  \ Pages 2-3 (background) \  \ We discuss Convertino et al. (2011) and few other works as suggested in relation to our work in reasoning the hypotheses. We also refer to these papers in defining the measures (pages 5-6), and in connection to our findings (pages 6-7) and the discussion (page 8). \  \ We decided to not refer to the body of literature about visualizations and feedback such as Bachour et al., CHI 2009, DiMicco and colleagues (CSCW 2004, HCI 2007), and Bergstrom and Karahalios, CHI 2007 (suggested by R6). These papers are typically oriented around the problem of balancing team membersâ€™ contributions to a conversation, which is not central to our current work. \  \ 2. The paper must clarify how the concept of ""implicit sharing"" is different from (or similar to) concepts like ""knowledge sharing"" and ""awareness"" from earlier work.  \  \ Pages 1-2 (background) \  \ We define â€œimplicit sharingâ€ù as automatic sharing of analysis insights. It is a type of the more general â€œknowledge sharingâ€ù, which was shown to be beneficial for improving awareness and common ground. However, not all knowledge sharing is implicit. For instance Convertino et al. (2011) designed knowledge sharing as an explicit act of copying pieces of information from a private space to a public space.   \  \ 3. The paper must be more clear about the contribution. What is new about this experiment -- what have we learned from this that we did not know before? How important is what we have learned?  \  \ Pages 2 (background) & 9 (conclusion) \  \ Our work stands out among other papers about collaborative analysis tools that evaluated their tools as a whole, ran informal studies, or did not evaluate their tools at all. Our contribution is understanding the effects of a specific design feature â€“ implicit sharing of insights using digital post-it notes â€“ in a controlled lab experiment on the process and outcomes of a collaborative analysis task. The results of our study can help clarify the benefits and costs of adding a specific design feature to collaborative analysis tools. \  \  4. Finally, while it may be difficult given the space constraints, try to make these revisions suggested in your rebuttal: \  \ - discuss the limitations, including potential disadvantages of implicit sharing \  \ - strengthen the argument about the ways in which the experiment task resembles real-world problems, and discuss what you think generalizes about these results and what aspects might not  \  \ Page 8 (limitations & generalization) \  \ We explain the problem of balancing a lab study against the real-world scope of analysis tasks. Our study was designed to simulate boundaries around access to data sources and could generalize to cases where such boundaries exist. However, there could be other design choices around sharing in general and implicit sharing in particular, and contextual factors might limit the benefits of our design of implicit sharing, such as organizational policies around what analysts are allowed to write in shared notes. \  \ Finally, as promised in the rebuttal, we strengthened the design implications to better connect our quantitative and qualitative findings with concrete design directions (p. 8-9). We also fixed some typos and tightened our paper by removing the redundancies. \  \ ",IxSc,Nitesh Goyal,Gilly Leshed,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:49,pn1471,A,Dynamic Difficulty Using Brain Metrics of Workload,Daniel,Afergan,afergan@gmail.com,pn1471-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Daniel Afergan, Evan M Peck, Erin T Solovey, Andrew Jenkins, Samuel W Hincks, Eli T Brown, Remco Chang, Robert J.K.

In this paper, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to obtain passive brain sensing data and detect extended periods of boredom or overload. From these physiological signals, we can adapt a simulation in order to optimize workload in real-time, which allows the system to better fit the task to the user from moment to moment. To demonstrate this idea, we ran a laboratory study in which participants performed path planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a simulation. Based on their state, we varied the difficulty of the task by adding or removing UAVs and found that we were able to decrease errors by 35% over a baseline condition. Our results show that we can use fNIRS brain sensing to detect task difficulty in real-time and construct an interface that improves user performance through dynamic difficulty adjustment.",Paper,Daniel Afergan,afergan@cs.tufts.edu,"1.

In this paper, we explore the use of consecutive distant taps to expand the touch screen input vocabulary. We analyzed time intervals and distances between consecutive taps during common applications on a tablet and verified that consecutive distant taps can be used conflict-free with existing touch gestures. We designed the two interaction techniques Ta-tap and Ta-Ta-tap that utilize consecutive distant taps. Ta-tap uses two consecutive distant taps to invoke alternative touch operations for multi-touch emulation, whereas Ta-Ta-tap uses a series of consecutive distant taps to define a spatial gesture. We verified the feasibility of both interaction techniques through a series of experiments and a user study. The high recognition rate of Ta-tap and Ta-Ta-tap gestures, the few conflicts with existing gestures, and the positive feedback from the participants assert the potential of consecutive distant taps as a new design space to enrich touch screen interactions.",Paper,Geehyuk Lee,geehyuk@gmail.com,"1.

We tried to respond to all issues that you summarized in the final review.  \  \ [Technical Details] \  \ - We described the pilot study on the time and distance between two taps in more detail, including the application use time and whether the participants had difficulties. (See p3, 1st and 2nd paragraph) \  \ - We explained that the pilot study on time and distance investigation of blind QWERTY typing experiment was performed at a same experiment. (See p5, 2nd paragraph under the heading â€œInvestigation on Blind QWERTY typingâ€ù) \  \ - We added an explanation of handling false positives for Ta-ta-tap. (See p6, last paragraph of â€œGesture Recognizerâ€ù section) \  \ - We changed the distance units from pixels to mm. When needed, we presented distances in both pixels and mm. \  \ - We added an explanation that the first two taps of Ta-ta-tap have to be distant taps in order to avoid conflict with touch gestures. (See p5, 1st paragraph under the heading â€œTa-ta-tap: Using Consecutive Distant Taps as Command Gestureâ€ù) \  \ - We referenced a study on zone and polygon menu in the Focus Group section after the description of using relative locations of two taps (Se	e p8, 1st paragraph under the heading â€œFocus Groupâ€ù). We also cited the Bezel-tap paper in the Related Work section (See p2, 1st paragraph under the heading â€œEnriching Touch Input Using Additional Modalitiesâ€ù).  \  \  \ [Writing and Presentation] \  \ - We revised and rewrote some terms. We removed the term â€œCassiopeia gestureâ€ù, which may confuse readers. We added more description to clarify the term â€œsecondary candidatesâ€ù. (See p7, 1st paragraph under the heading â€œResult: Gesture Recognition Performanceâ€ù) \  \ - We revised all figures so that they have a better resolution (>300dpi). Texts in the figures are enlarged for better legibility.  \  \ - We fixed the error in the legend labels in Figure 10 (currently, Figure 9) \  \ - We explained the reason of not comparing our technique with previous study on using gestures, emphasizing that our technique is a complementary one. (See p9, in â€œConclusionâ€ù) \  \ - We added a reference to justify the number of participants in the focus group study. (See p8, 1st paragraph under the heading â€œFocus Groupâ€ù) \  \ - We added illustrated examples to the input space in Figure 1 for better understanding of the â€œunexplored input spaceâ€ù. \  \ - As more explanations were added, the paper length exceeded the ten-page limit. In order to make room for the changes, we decided to remove Figure 2, which shows the proportion of collected touch operations.  The proportion of collected touch operations is not that important in the context of the paper. We instead described briefly the numbers of touch operations in the text. \ ",,Seongkook Heo,Jiseong Gu,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:31,pn1475,A,Supporting Treatment of People Living with HIV / AIDS in Resource Limited Settings with IVRs,Anirudha,Joshi,anirudha@iitb.ac.in,pn1475-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Anirudha Joshi, Mandar Rane, Debjani Roy, Nagraj Emmadi, Padma Srinivasan, N Kumarasamy, Sanjay Pujari, Davidson Solomon, Rashmi Rodrigues, DG Saple, Kamalika Sen, Els Veldeman, Romain Rutten","anirudha@iitb.ac.in, mrane@iitb.ac.in, debjanir@gmail.com, nagrajmumba@gmail.com, padma.srinivasan90@gmail.com, kumarasamy@yrgcare.org, sanjaypujari@gmail.com, drdavidsonsolomon@rediffmail.com, rashmijr@gmail.com, clinic@drsaple.com, ksen@grameenfoundation.in, EVELDEMA@its.jnj.com, RRUTTEN@its.jnj.com",4169,Anirudha,,Joshi,anirudha@iitb.ac.in,,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay",Mumbai,Maharashtra,India,,,,,,38048,Mandar,,Rane,mrane@iitb.ac.in,,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay",Mumbai,,India,,,,,,38049,Debjani,,Roy,debjanir@gmail.com,,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay",Mumbai,,India,,,,,,28503,Nagraj,,Emmadi,nagrajmumba@gmail.com,,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay",Mumbai,,India,,,,,,38050,Padma,,Srinivasan,padma.srinivasan90@gmail.com,,"Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay",Mumbai,,India,,,,,,38051,N,,Kumarasamy,kumarasamy@yrgcare.org,,YRG Care,Chennai,,India,,,,,,38052,Sanjay,,Pujari,sanjaypujari@gmail.com,,Institute of Infectious Diseases,Pune,,India,,,,,,38053,Davidson,,Solomon,drdavidsonsolomon@rediffmail.com,,Shadows,Chirala,,India,,,,,,38054,Rashmi,,Rodrigues,rashmijr@gmail.com,,St. John's Hospital,Bangalore,,India,,,,,,38055,DG,,Saple,clinic@drsaple.com,,HHRF,Mumbai,,India,,,,,,38056,Kamalika,,Sen,ksen@grameenfoundation.in,,Grameen Foundation,New Delhi,,India,,,,,,38057,Els,,Veldeman,EVELDEMA@its.jnj.com,,Johnson and Johnson,Brussels,,Belgium,,,,,,38058,Romain,,Rutten,RRUTTEN@its.jnj.com,,Johnson and Johnson,Brussels,,Belgium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We developed an interactive voice response (IVR) system called TAMA (Treatment Advice by Mobile Alerts) that provides treatment support to people living with HIV / AIDS (PLHA) in developing countries, who are on antiret-roviral therapy (ART).

We believe that mobile device accessibility could be improved through designs that take into account usersâ€™ functional abilities and take advantage of available space around the wheelchair itself. In this paper we present findings from multiple design sessions and interviews with 13 power wheelchair users and 30 clinicians, exploring the placement and form factor possibilities for input and output on a power wheelchair. We found that many power wheelchair users could benefit from chairable technology that is designed to work within the workspace of the wheelchair, whether worn on the body or mounted on he wheelchair frame.

This paper introduces the notion of concept evolution, the changing nature of a person's underlying concept (the abstract notion of the target class a person is labeling for, e.g., spam email, travel related web pages) which can result in inconsistent labels and thus be detrimental to machine learning. We introduce two structured labeling solutions, a novel technique we propose for helping people define and refine their concept in a consistent manner as they label. Through a series of five experiments, including a controlled lab study, we illustrate the impact and dynamics of concept evolution in practice and show that structured labeling helps people label more consistently in the presence of concept evolution than traditional labeling.",Paper,Todd Kulesza,kuleszto@eecs.oregonstate.edu,"1.

Skin is fundamentally different from off-body touch surfaces, opening up a new and largely unexplored interaction space. We investigate characteristics of the various skin-specific input modalities, analyze what kinds of gestures are performed on skin, and study what are preferred input locations. Our main findings show that (1) users intuitively leverage the properties of skin for a wide range of more expressive commands than on conventional touch surfaces; (2) established multi-touch gestures can be transferred to on-skin input; (3) physically uncomfortable modalities are deliberately used for irreversible commands and expressing negative emotions; and (4) the forearm and the hand are the most preferred locations on the upper limb for on-skin input.

We found that, for both attitude consistent and inconsistent information, the expertise indicator increased the selection of sources indicated to have high expertise and decreased that of low expertise. Moreover, when both source expertise and position indicators were present, usersâ€™ selective exposure tendency, i.e., preferential selection of attitude consistent sources over inconsistent ones, decreased among expert sources. Moreover, we found that the expertise indicator could serve the purpose of encouraging common ground seeking with different others by increasing the agreement with, and perceived expertise of inconsistent sources indicated to be experts. Design implications for moderating selective exposure by highlighting the utility of dissonant information were discussed.",Paper,Q.

R2 and R4 requested that we clarify why we used the term framework and not method. This has been clarified in the last paragraph in section â€˜D4D: A Framework for Neurodiversity in PDâ€™ which states: \ â€œWe intentionally employ the term framework, as opposed to method or tool, as the term reflects the necessary flexibility D4D provides designers in developing methods appropriate to their specific context and constraints, whereas method implies more rigidity and precise replication. In considering designersâ€™ agency and need for flexibility in conducting design research, the D4D framework guides them in tailoring their PD methods to enable the participation of neurodiverse populations. â€œ  \  \ 2.	R3 questions how D4D innovates over the TEACCH approach. We have clarified this within the Discussion section, making our specific contribution of adapting the original TEACCH framework clearer within the first paragraph, which states: \ â€œOur contribution is not in developing a novel PD method, as many of the features we identified in our neurodiverse PD methods are not novel. Rather it is the adaptation of the TEACCH education principles as a design framework that scaffolds designers in the creation of new PD methods for children with a range of neurodiverse conditions, guiding them to identify the specific combination of PD features most appropriate for their target population. The implications of our work are three-fold.â€ù \  \ 3.	R3 was concerned about the provision of evidence about certain claims and wanted a deeper analysis of fewer points of the framework. We have therefore re-written the third paragraph of our Practice-Informed PD: one-to-one workshops section, to ensure our findings were not over-stated, which now states:  \ â€œHowever, once we changed our protocol to incorporate example ideas and partially completed interface designs, children were able to expand on the ideas given, and in some cases generate their own idea(s) where previously they had been unable to do so.â€œ \ We have also included some of the questions raised by R3 within the fifth paragraph of the discussion section, which states: \ â€œAs systematically evaluating the outcomes of this framework is beyond the scope of this work, it would be valuable if designers using D4D evaluated and reported on the outcomes of their methods with different populations; potentially considering the quantity, quality and/or novelty of ideas generated using their method.â€ù \  \ 4.	R1 suggests that we should be more specific about how attention to the specific strengths is deployed. We have therefore added in a section about the strengths of children with ASD within the third paragraph of the Theoretically-informed PD section, which states: \ â€œChildren with ASD often have exceptional knowledge or skills in areas related to their special interests [22] and therefore integrating these into the design process allows them to contribute their knowledge/skills. â€œ \  \ 5.	Both R1 and R4 raise concerns about the balance between the positive and negative within the paper. To address this point, we have added in the characteristic difficulties associated with the neurodiverse conditions within Table 1.  \  \ 6.	R1 also requests for the role of the designer to be defined and clarified within the paper. Therefore we have added in a definition within the third paragraph of the introduction, which states: \ â€œâ€_who are responsible for creating and developing interactive digital productsâ€_â€ù \  \ 7.	We have clarified that one of the researchers undertook the role of an interaction designer within the case studies as requested by R1 within the first paragraph of the Practice-informed PD sections for both case studies. \  \ 8.	We have briefly indicated the design activities that the children are more suited to participating in, as mentioned by R1, within the first paragraph of the Discussion section, which states: \ â€œWe found that children were most suited to contributing ideas and evaluating different design options. However, as some children also had extensive technical knowledge/skills, they additionally had the potential to contribute towards assessing technical feasibility and developing design prototypes.â€ù \  \ 9.	We have reordered the Introduction as advised by R2 and switched the first two paragraphs. \  \ 10.	R2 suggested moving the worked example of the framework for ADHD to earlier in the paper and we have a created a new section before the Discussion section called Adapting the D4D Framework and included this example here. \  \ 11.	R1 recommended that the attention points in small caps be organised into a checklist style table, but as these already corresponded to the boxes within the D4D framework (Figs 2 + 3) we have instead numbered the points in the text and the associated boxes in the figures to highlight this correspondence. \  \ 12.	R1 highlights the link with the work of Van Rijn, we have therefore referenced this work in the final paragraph of the paper, which states: \ â€œThis draws parallels with the work of Van Rijn [25] who highlights the challenges of designers working with â€˜extremeâ€™ user groups they share little in common with, and how insights from designing with one particular group can actually contribute to an understanding of how to design for any user group.â€œ \  \ 13.	R5 suggests parallels with the Harder et al. paper from Design Issues and the concept of â€˜designing forâ€™ versus â€˜designing withâ€™, which we have referenced this work in the first paragraph of the Discussion section, which states: \ â€œFurthermore, within PD, participants can play multiple roles, at various levels of involvement [17]. For meaningful participation, neurodiverse children require support to emphasize their strengths, and provisions to mitigate their difficulties. This enables a deeper level of involvement where designers â€˜learn withâ€™ the participants during the design process rather than simply â€˜learning aboutâ€™ [17].â€ù \  \ ",,Laura Benton,Asimina Vasalou,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 16:50,pn1518,A,Design Tactics for Authentic Interactive Fiction: Insights from Alternate Reality Game Designers,Elizabeth,Bonsignore,elizabeth.bonsignore@gmail.com,pn1518-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Elizabeth Bonsignore, Vicki Moulder, Carman Neustaedter, Derek Hansen, kari kraus kraus, Allison Druin","ebonsign@umd.edu, vmoulder@sfu.ca, carman_neustaedter@sfu.ca, dlhansen@byu.edu, karimkraus@gmail.com, allisond@umiacs.umd.edu",15706,Elizabeth,,Bonsignore,ebonsign@umd.edu,,University of Maryland,College Park,Maryland,United States,,University of Maryland,College Park,Maryland,United States,18768,Vicki,,Moulder,vmoulder@sfu.ca,,Simon Fraser University,Surrey,British Columbia,Canada,,Simon Fraser University,Surrey,British Columbia,Canada,3090,Carman,,Neustaedter,carman_neustaedter@sfu.ca,School of Interactive Arts + Technology,Simon Fraser University,Surrey,British Columbia,Canada,,Simon Fraser University,Surrey,British Columbia,Canada,6547,Derek,,Hansen,dlhansen@byu.edu,,"Ira A.

However, research on popular exergames shows mixed health benefits, potentially due to minimal energy expenditure and decreasing use over time. This paper presents a 2x2 experimental study (N = 44), using a popular exergame, where we vary the framing of intention (i.e., â€œGameplayâ€ù or â€œExerciseâ€ù) and feedback (i.e., â€œHealthâ€ù or â€œNo healthâ€ù) to explore their single and interactive impacts on perceived exertion, objectively measured energy expenditure, affect, and duration of usage in a single session. Our study showed that participants primed with exercise used the system significantly longer than those primed with game play (M = 49.2 Â±2.0 min versus M = 39.3 Â±2.0 min). We discuss our results and possible design implications based on our single-session experiment. We conclude with a discussion on the potential impact of focusing on â€œhealthifyingâ€ù exergamesâ€”highlighting an exergamesâ€™ dual purpose as both a game and exerciseâ€”as opposed to gamifying health behaviors.",Paper,Eric Hekler,ehekler@asu.edu,"1.

This paper presents a qualitative study of 17 seniors in urban China (age ranging from 50s to 70s), who have adopted and incorporated ICT into their daily lives. Findings from this study show that the ways in which seniors attend to ICT are not simply shaped by changes in health or other wellbeing, but also by their life attitudes, value systems, relationships to younger generations as well as historical specifics during their coming of age. This paper contributes by showing that 1) what it means to be senior is shaped from within a whole social ecology of past and current experiences, values and interactions; 2) senior identities are not fixed, but continuously negotiated, articulated and enacted through ICT; 3) social interaction and access of technologies are highly intertwined.",Paper,Xianghua (Sharon) Ding,xianghua.ding@gmail.com,"1.

This is known as the `intention gap' and is particularly problematic when searching for and discriminating between online video content. An author uses description and meta-data tags to label their content, but often cannot predict alternate interpretations or appropriations of their work. To address this intention gap, we present ThumbReels, a concept for query-sensitive video previews generated from crowdsourced, temporally defined semantic tagging. Further, we supply an open-source tool that supports on-the-fly temporal tagging of videos, whose output can be used for later search queries. A first user study validates the tool and concept. We then present a second study that shows participants found ThumbReels to better represent search terms than contemporary preview techniques. ",Note,Barnaby Craggs,b.craggs@lancaster.ac.uk,"1.

","1 - Page 1: Inserted authors names and details - Inserted Copyright acknowledgement . \  \ 2 - In response to the reviewers request to clarify motivation in the Intro & Study Design sections, we have added the following in the introduction section (Page 1, column 2, final paragraph): \  \ Rather than creating simple musical statements based solely on the individual structural elements and test them in isolation, we chose to compose fully formed musical extracts. We felt it was important to consider the balance between these structural elements and other musical content (i.e. the melodyâ€™s accompaniment). This also provided the participants with an authentic listening experience that assisted us in capturing a range of supporting data, such as their thoughts and feelings. \  \ And the following in the study design section (Page 3, column 1, 2nd paragraph): \  \ Each of these elements were embedded within a fully formed musical extract, to maintain a traditional compositional approach and a normal listening experience.  \  \ 3 - In response to the reviewers request to reference the Wilkie (2010) paper, we have inserted the following text (Page 2, column 2, bottom of 3rd paragraph): \  \ Other work has explored the application of conceptual metaphor theory into the design of music software user interfaces, physical interaction design and music analysis [22].  \  \ 4 - In response to the reviewers request to draw in work on audio spatialization techniques into the Discussion section, we have inserted the following (Page 9, column 2, last paragraph): \  \ At this point it is worth returning to the related work on sound navigation systems, which use auditory spatialization techniques [6]. We can foresee opportunities for these techniques to integrate with, and supplement, our composing principles to further enrich a composition framework for mobile experiences, primarily in terms of guidance. For example, the application of stereo panning to indicate orientation would complement the use of harmonic motion and dynamic contours, in guiding a listenerâ€™s approach towards a point of interest. This identifies a theme for future work. \  \ 5 â€“ In response to the reviewers request to see data and discussion on walking speed and direction changes we have added the following to the results section (Page 7, column 1 & 2): \  \ Walking Speed, Distance and Duration \ Analysis of walking speed commenced from participants z1 trigger point (initiation of music playback) until termination of their walks. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed and pairwise comparisons between the four compositions show a significant difference between C3 and the other three compositions (C1-C3 p = 0.002: C2-C3 p = 0.000: C3-C4 p = 0.001). 6 participants discussed a perceived increase of walking pace on C3, â€œmade me walk in some kind of velocity, and â€œI carried on walking, just getting into that paceâ€ù. No significant differences were observed on task distance or duration. \  \ And this to the discussion section (Page 8, column 2, final paragraph): \  \ Walking behaviour \ The statistical difference in walking speed observed on C3 may have been as a result of C3â€™s faster tempo (C1 = 60bpm, C2 = 90bpm, C3 = 120bpm, C4 = 54bpm), which references prior research on the synchronisation of physical movement to tempi [20]. We would expect therefore, C2â€™s mean walking speed to be placed centrally between C1 & C3 as was its tempo (90bpm), but this was not observed. To support a robust analysis and discussion on this theme a controlled experimental setting would have been required. We also noted participants engaging in marked changes of direction whilst on task, which prompted an analysis of direction changes in response to musical changes (transitions between zones), but no apparent systematic correlation was found. \  \ 6 â€“ Figures 2-5 have been re-created to clarify zone labelling, and participants start and end locations. Table 1 has been converted to percentages and Table 2 now presents the data as boxplots. \  \ 7 â€“ To find space to allow for these additions, numerous minor edits have been addressed throughout; Figure 6 (The container model) has been removed; and 4 references, all of which duplicate other referenced work. \  \  \  \  \  \ ",,Adrian Hazzard,Steve Benford,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 18:36,pn1579,A,Designing For Movement: Evaluating Computational Models using LMA Effort Qualities,Sarah,Fdili Alaoui,sfdilial@sfu.ca,pn1579-paper.pdf,10,letter,Times-Roman,,"Diego Silang Maranan, Sarah Fdili Alaoui, Thecla Schiphorst, Philippe Pasquier, Pattarawut Subyen","diegom@alumni.sfu.cq, sfdilial@sfu.ca, thecla@sfu.ca, pasquier@sfu.ca, psubyen@sfu.ca",38148,Diego,,Silang Maranan,diegom@alumni.sfu.cq,School of Interactive Art and Technology,Simon Fraser University,Vancouver,British Columbia,Canada,,,,,,20243,Sarah,,Fdili Alaoui,sfdilial@sfu.ca,School of Interactive Arts + Technology,Simon Fraser University,Surrey,British Columbia,Canada,,,,,,3338,Thecla,,Schiphorst,thecla@sfu.ca,School of Interactive Arts and Technology ,Simon Fraser University,Vancouver,British Columbia,Canada,,,,,,14845,Philippe,,Pasquier,pasquier@sfu.ca,,Simon Fraser University,Surrey,British Columbia,Canada,,,,,,18192,Pattarawut,,Subyen,psubyen@sfu.ca,SIAT,Simon Fraser University,Vancouver,British Columbia,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While single-accelerometers are a common consumer embedded sensors, their use in representing movement data as an intelligent resource remains scarce.

The system applies Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) to recognize Laban Effort qualities from acceleration input using a Machine Learning software that generates classifications in real time. Existing LMA-recognition systems rely on motion capture data and video data, and can only be deployed in controlled settings.

","Revision report of submission #1579:  \ Designing For Movement: Evaluating Computational Models using LMA Effort Qualities \  \ We would like to thank the Meta-reviewer and all the reviewers for their positive and encouraging remarks and for their suggestions and critiques.  We report hereafter on the modifications that we made in preparation for final submission of our paper.  \  \ 1) As suggested by the Meta-reviewer, we added a sentence in the introduction (paragraph 2, page 2) about the ""handing over"" feature of our system: ""The advantage of using accelerometers is that they are small and thus highly portable, and can be used under a wide range of environmental conditions including interactive installations targeting general public audience, interactive performances or mobile applications. In such conditions, a compelling feature of single-accelerometer systems is their pervasive ability to pragmatically 'hand over' interaction capability between users. Our approach to selecting single-accelerometer systems emphasizes the often precarious and critical temporal transactions between users. Interaction designers may trade-off the recognition accuracy from multiple accelerometers systems for the ease and simple handing over of one accelerometer between users. This is a key pervasive feature for Art settings, as well as mobile device uses."" \  \ 2) We addressed the issue of the motivation of our work in regards of the use of a single-accelerometer by adding a first sentence in the Abstract, and a full paragraph in the Introduction (paragraph 2, page 2). \  \ 3) We indicated at the end section of our paper the benefits of our approach and its potential for application areas. Concretely, we added 3 paragraphs in the beginning of our section â€œApplications in HCI and digital performanceâ€ù, (paragraph 1, page 8). \  \ 4) We replaced the sentence in paragraph 2, page 5: â€œDuring the training phase, the dancer in collaboration with Laban Certified Movement Analyst (CMA) recorded examples of the BEAsâ€ù by the sentence proposed in the rebuttal: â€œDuring the training phase, an expert Laban Certified Movement Analyst (CMA) from the dance department of the University of Illinois recorded examples of the BEAs. During performance the recognition process would evaluate other dancers execution of the BEAs.â€ù   \  \ 5) We changed the picture of the Figure 7 to illustrate the use of EFFORTDETECT with EMVIZ visualization system in both contexts of a dance performance and a general audience interactive installation.  \  \ 6) We added one reference on MQs used as interaction modality in HCI of Fdili Alaoui et al, DIS2012, and corrected the reference of Widemer and Kubat, Machine Leaning1996.  \  \ 7) In the whole paper, we took into consideration the reviews comment on spelling, and formatting issues, including in the title and the references.  \  \  \  \ ",artIx,Sarah Fdili Alaoui,Thecla Schiphorst,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:47,pn1583,A,VacuumTouch: Attractive Force Feedback Interface for Haptic Interactive Surface using Air Suction,Taku,Hachisu,hachisu@kaji-lab.jp,pn1583-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Taku Hachisu, masaaki fukumoto","hachisu@kaji-lab.jp, fukumoto@acm.org",21019,Taku,,Hachisu,hachisu@kaji-lab.jp,,The University of Electro-Communications,Chofu,Tokyo,Japan,,JSPS Research Fellow,,Tokyo,Japan,2520,masaaki,,fukumoto,fukumoto@acm.org,,Microsoft Research,Beijing,,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We present VacuumTouch, a novel haptic interface architecture for touch screens that provides attractive force feedback to the userâ€™s finger. VacuumTouch consists of an air pump and solenoid air valves that connect to the surface of the touch screen and suck the air above the surface where the userâ€™s finger makes contact. VacuumTouch does not require the user to hold or attach additional devices to provide the attractive force, which allows for easy interaction with the surface. This paper introduces the implementation of the VacuumTouch architecture and some applications for enhancement of the graphical user interface, namely a suction button, a suction slider, and a suction dial. The quantitative evaluation was conducted with the suction dial and showed that the attractive force provided by VacuumTouch improved the performance of the dial menu interface and its potential effects.

In addition, we have provided responses to all of the questions and comments of the reviewers and the AC. Our point-by-point responses are given below. \  \ The first paragraph in the Introduction needs to be tidied up. The second sentence makes no sense - 'User performance has been improved user performance' \ - We modified the text in second sentence in the first paragraph as follows; \ ""User performance has been improved, e.g., selecting and clicking visual widgets on the screen [9, 27], because the touch screens themselves do not have mechanical-button-like haptic feedback."" \  \ In the Architecture section, you state 'We employed a rotary vane dry vacuum pump (Sato Vac Inc., ODF-50W) because it produces less pulsation, which seems to have an unexpected effect on haptic sensation' \ - We added the description on an unexpected effect produced by another type of vacuum pump as follows; \ ""We employed a rotary vane dry vacuum pump (Sato Vac Inc., ODF-50W) because it produces less pulsation than other types of vacuum pumps. For example, diaphragm pump seems to have an unexpected effect (e.g., vibration) on haptic sensation."" \  \ The latency study should be in its own subsection, not in the feedback specification subsection. \ - We added a new subsection  ""Latency"" describing the latency study. \  \ There are some missing details about the vibrotactile feedback - what vibration motor was used? How long was the vibration pulse, what was the amplitude, frequency etc? \ - We added the details about the vibrotactile feedback as follows; \ ""We measured the vibration using an accelerometer (Yamaichi Electronics Co., Ltd., Yamco 110B and 4101) on the touch screen surface. The peak amplitude and frequency were around 0.5G (4.9m/s2) and 130 Hz, respectively. The amplitude plateaued 100ms after activation."" \  \ The friction sensation paragraph in the discussion needs to be tidied up, it is hard to follow. \ - We added a new subsection ""Design Considerations"" summarizing possible applications. \  \ The other changes are as follows; \ - Copyright block has been inserted \ -The paper was edited by a native speaker again. \  \ ////////// First Revision////////// \ Please find the enclosed manuscript, which is a re-submission of our \ previous paper with extensive revisions. \ We very much appreciate the peer reviewer's insightful comments, our \ major revision are as follows; \  \ -We added two references recommended by a reviewer. \ -We added the feedback specifications. \ -We deleted the description about mobile devices. \ -We reduced the number of experimental hypotheses to 3 and focused the \ results section on these findings. \ -We modified our future direction. \ -The paper was edited by a native speaker.","games, IxSc, artIx",Taku Hachisu,masaaki fukumoto,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 17:45,pn1586,A,ISSE: An Interactive Source Separation Editor,Nicholas,Bryan,njb@ccrma.stanford.edu,pn1586-paper.pdf,10,letter,Times-Roman Helvetica Helvetica-BoldOblique Helvetica Helvetica-BoldOblique Helvetica Helvetica-BoldOblique Helvetica Helvetica-BoldOblique Helvetica Helvetica-BoldOblique,,"Nicholas J Bryan, Gautham J Mysore, Ge Wang","njb@ccrma.stanford.edu, gmysore@adobe.com, ge@ccrma.stanford.edu",38145,Nicholas,J,Bryan,njb@ccrma.stanford.edu,Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics,Stanford University,Palo Alto,CA,United States,,,,,,24668,Gautham,J,Mysore,gmysore@adobe.com,,Adobe Systems Inc.,San Francisco,California,United States,,,,,,14639,Ge,,Wang,ge@ccrma.stanford.edu,Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics,Stanford University,Palo Alto,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Traditional audio editing tools do not facilitate the task of separating a single mixture recording (e.g. pop song) into its respective sources (e.g. drums, vocal, etc.).  Such ability, however, would be very useful for a wide variety of audio applications such as music remixing, audio denoising, and audio-based forensics. To address this issue, we present ISSE--an interactive source separation editor.  ISSE is a new open-source, freely available, and cross-platform audio editing tool that enables a user to perform  source separation by painting on time-frequency visualizations of sound, resulting in an interactive machine learning system.  The system brings to life our previously proposed interaction paradigm and separation algorithm that learns from user-feedback to perform separation. For evaluation, we conducted user studies and compared results between inexperienced and expert users.  For a variety of real-world tasks, we found that inexperienced users can achieve good separation quality with minimal instruction and expert users can achieve state-of-the-art separation quality.

Furthermore, it can be difficult to recall the steps to show while talking and operating the system all at the same time. An alternative is to present with pre-recorded screencast videos. It is, however, challenging to precisely match the narration to the video when using existing video players. We introduce DemoWiz, a video presentation system that provides an increased awareness of upcoming actions through glanceable visualizations. DemoWiz supports better control of timing by overlaying visual cues and enabling lightweight editing. A user study shows that our design significantly improves the presentersâ€™ perceived ease of narration and timing compared to a system without visualizations that was similar to a standard playback control. Furthermore, nine (out of ten) participants preferred DemoWiz over the standard playback control with the last expressing no preference.",Paper,Pei-Yu Chi,peggychi@eecs.berkeley.edu,"1.

Yet there are few studies of the actual conversational routines of these groups as well as the social challenges that might arise as a result of technology usage. To address this gap, we conducted an interview and diary study that explores the conversational practices of distance-separated grandparents and young grandchildren (aged 3-10) from the perspective of the grandparents and parents of the children. Our results describe the focus of grandparent-grandchild conversations and show that grandparent-grandchild communication is not without its challenges: grandparents sometimes feel self-conscious, perceive that parents or children will be annoyed if they ask too many questions, and do not want to interfere too much in their grandchildrenâ€™s lives. The implication is that designs should attempt to support the conversation routines and needs of grandparents and grandchildren while attempting to mitigate the social challenges.",Paper,Azadeh Forghani,azadehf@sfu.ca,"1.

Our work reveals five dimensions for the design of innominate movement representation: concealing the association between movement and representation; number of represented movements; number of players with representations; location of representation in relation to the body and technical attributes of representation.

Below we have listed the changes made, categorized by section and generally listed by occurrence in the paper. We have tried to address the reviewersâ€™ concerns to the best of our abilities and provided additional details where data and page limit allowed us to do. We thank the reviewers for their consideration. \  \ ABSTRACT \ Updated dimension 2 name change accordingly. \  \ INTRODUCTION \ No changes. \  \ RELATED WORK \ 1) R5 wanted resources on ambiguous design and indirect sensor mappings to position our work. \  \ Changes done: We added a couple of lines to discuss ambiguity in HCI, explaining the position of our work in relation to existing work on ambiguity as follows: â€œ Gaver et al.â€™s work [8] shows how incorporating ambiguity into the design of interactive systems can have intriguing, mysterious, and delightful outcomes, such as the ambiguity of using indirect sensor mappings of embodied interaction (e.g. [1]), unconventional mappings for reflection on the unexpected (e.g. [24]), or exploring the interpretive space of embodied and situated aspects of interaction that results in physical play facilitating discovery (e.g. [29]). Thus, we were inspired to extend the notion of ambiguous interaction design to the representation of movement to uncover whether having an unclear relationship between movement and representation can facilitate engaging play experiences.â€ù \  \ 2) R4 suggested Marquez et al.â€™s work on effect of technological support on player judgment in body games. \  \ Changes done: We added this near the end of the related work section as follows: â€œTechnological support for such types of physical play experiences is minimal, with an often-increased reliance on player judgement (e.g. [17]).â€ù \  \ USING INNOMINATE MOVEMENT REPRESENTATION AS A DIGITAL GAME ELEMENT \ No changes. \  \ STUDY \ 1) R4 desired explanation on specifics of number of rounds & people who played at each venue. \  \ Changes done: We added the following lines to the â€œparticipantsâ€ù subsection: â€œ8 rounds were played at each venue, at a total of 4 venues, with each venue having between 5-7 participants. Overall, this meant the game was played 32 times during our study.â€ù \  \ 2) R4 asked about the players selecting roles during the study. \  \ Changes done: We added the following lines to the â€œprocedureâ€ù subsection: â€œWe ensured everyone played every role in the game, so that all players could reflect on these roles during the interviews. Our encouragement to play every role is obviously not present in non-study contexts; however, we believe the benefit of our approach of having everyone play each role gave us the advantage of a diverse range of feedback.â€ù \  \ 3) R4 asked about the rigor that went into the process of extracting findings from the data. \  \ Changes done: We added the following to â€œdata gathering and analysisâ€ù: â€œFirstly, the primary author watched all video recordings of people playing i-dentity. The author took notes while watching all of the gameplay recordings 3 times as suggested by grounded theory [28]. Secondly, the author watched the video recordings of the interviews 3 times. Again, the author took notes. Finally, the primary author went back and watched the video recordings of people playing i-dentity to check with the notes taken during the interview recordings. After each stage of this process, the primary author gathered with the other authors to discuss the notes taken. At these meetings, interim analysis results were presented and debated. This helped to develop and refine findings. We used an open-ended process of rapid reflection [21] to discuss ideas and concepts that had emerged. The findings emerging from the data were heavily questioned, debated and discussed. \  \ The resulting higher-level concepts were discussed amongst the group and then presented to 10 games researchers to gather feedback. The outcome was subsequently checked with 8 of the study participants (those who where available, so a selection bias might have occurred), refined and reviewed again by the authors.â€ù \  \ FINDINGS \ No changes. \  \ DESIGN DIMENSIONS \ 1) R5 requested our work to incorporate existing resources on ambiguous design and indirect mappings. \  \ Changes done: We added the following to Dimension 1 to better situate our work by integrating the resources suggested by R5: â€œWhile most movement-based systems are designed using a direct mapping of the playersâ€™ movements to digital representations, i-dentity extends the notion of ambiguous design to show how this mapping can be purposely obscured to facilitate an engaging play experience. This rather unconventional method of mapping input to output reminds us of Rogers et al.â€™s Snark system [24] that uses ambient technologies to explore the concept of the unexpected to foster reflection. Similarly, Gaver et al.â€™s work on ambiguous design [8] suggests benefits of employing ambiguity in mappings between input and output when designing interactive systems, with an example being Antle et al.â€™s whole-body system [1], which deploys ambiguous design through indirect mappings of embodied interaction. We extend this thinking to game design and showed with i-dentity some benefits to having movements conceal associations between movement and representation.â€ù \  \ 2) R1 found Dimension 2 was confusing due to the mixing up of sensors and representations. \  \ Changes done: We edited our title to more clearly communicate Dimension 2 to: â€œNumber of Represented Movementsâ€ù. We also edited the description of dimension 2 to the following: â€œOur second dimension looks at the extent to which designers adjust the number of represented vs. non-represented movements. The two poles of this dimension are made up of either having one playerâ€™s movement represented on one end or having multiple playersâ€™ movements represented on the other. Although we opted for a single playerâ€™s sensed movement representation to be copied across to other playersâ€™ controllers (Fig.18), designs could alternatively represent all players in a system and just be unclear as to who is controlling which representation. Prior work has shown how multiplayer movement-based games use interactive technology to enable rich social play [12] and this can occur by giving players shared control of one representation (e.g. [11]). We now describe different options designers have for mapping input to output by having either one movement representation or multiple movements represented.â€ù \  \ The dimension 2.1 and 2.2 names were changed to reflect the dimension 2 edits to the following: â€œDimension 2.1: One movement representedâ€ù and â€œDimension 2.2: Multiple movements representedâ€ù. \  \ Furthermore, we added Fig. 18 to help better illustrate this design concept. \  \ DESIGN STRATEGIES \ No changes. \  \ EXTENDING THE APPLICATION OF INNOMINATE MOVEMENT REPRESENTATION IN GAME DESIGN \ 1) All reviewers wanted to know how innominate movement representation could be applied to games outside of i-dentity. \  \ Changes done: We added a new section titled â€œExtending the Application of Innominate Movement Representation in Game Designâ€ù. This section details practical game ideas of using our innominate mechanic in various â€˜application domainsâ€™, with descriptions of these proposed games under the following subsections: â€œExtending innominate representations through shared avatar control to facilitate social playâ€ù, â€œUsing innominate representations could be useful to foster awareness of physical activity while addressing privacy concernsâ€ù, â€œExtending innominate gameplay through orientation of bodies in relation to a screen as engaging elementâ€ù, and â€œExtending innominate interaction design with alternate input methods while facilitating knowledge of own and anotherâ€™s bodyâ€ù. \  \ CONCLUSION \ No changes. \  \ REFERENCES \ References were updated accordingly.",games,Jayden Garner,Florian Mueller,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:46,pn1628,A,TouchSense: Expanding Touchscreen Input Vocabulary Using Different Areas of Users' Finger Pads,Da-Yuan,Huang,dayuansmile@gmail.com,pn1628-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Da-Yuan Huang, Ming-Chang Tsai, Ying-Chao Tung, Min-Lun Tsai, Yen-Ting Yeh, Liwei Chan, Yi-Ping Hung, Mike Y.

For example, users of a calculator application on a smart watch could tap normally to enter numbers, and tap with the right side of their fingers to enter the operators (e.g. +, -, =). Results from two human-factor studies showed that users could tap a touchscreen with five or more distinct areas of their finger pads. Also, they were able to tap with more distinct areas closer to their fingertips.

We have incorporated this within the existing structure around the challenges of â€˜Interpretationâ€™, â€˜Personalizationâ€™ and â€˜Socializationâ€™, referring to previous work we found most relevant to our own and the challenges we aim to address with our approach. We include a reference to Laaksolahti et al.â€™s work on the Lega system for sharing responses socially, and return to this in our discussion where we reflect on the differences (see â€˜How gift giving shapes socializationâ€™). \  \ We also proposed to expand on the implications of how our technique might be used in practice, including who it might be used by and how the approach could be streamlined for more practical use. In our final version, we have extended our â€˜Conclusionsâ€™ section to include â€˜Design Implicationsâ€™. Here we discuss the kinds of visitors we think might benefit most from our approach and why they might invest the time and effort required. We also point to the future challenge of delivering the approach at scale, such as how our design workshops could be replaced with an online service that could allow visitors to create and download experiences prior to their visit. \  \ We noted in our rebuttal that we needed to emphasise how our approach responds to recent trends in museum interpretation. We refer to Whitehead (2012) and Simon (2010) in our introduction to emphasise how it is becoming common for museums and galleries to invite visitors to engage with multiple interpretations or to create and share their own content around objects. \  \ Finally we proposed to clarify our position that the moments of discomfort experienced by our participants could be highly rewarding whilst not being typically pleasant. We come to this in our discussion, pointing out that cultural experiences with contemporary art can often be challenging, and refer to Benford et al.â€™s work which argues that there can be benefits to moments of discomfort in cultural experiences.  \  \ Discussion at PC Meeting \  \ We thank the PC members for the additional feedback and have incorporated the suggested changes as follows: \  \ The first point from the PC meeting asked us to talk more about how the experiences were constructed. We have responded firstly by including practical details of the design workshops in our â€˜Approachâ€™ section â€“ the specific resources available and examples of questions asked to participants to elicit ideas. Secondly, in our â€˜Findingsâ€™ section (â€˜An overview of the designsâ€™) we added details of how participants came to their design choices and where participants deviated from the experience template. Finally, we reiterate in our conclusions that by working with a predefined template, our participants were able to successfully design personalized experiences. \  \ The second point was that we should strengthen the motivation for our work. We have addressed this in our introduction by referring to recent trends in museum interpretation and the challenge of designing for the deceptive notion of an â€˜averageâ€™ visitor. We also point to the potential benefits of the approach in the penultimate paragraph of our introduction â€“ that our approach might address the issues of interpretation, personalization and socialization in an integrated way, and could lead to intense and personally meaningful engagement with cultural artifacts. \  \ The third point from the PC discussion was that we should be more reflective on what was learned from the study. To address this, we extended our â€˜Conclusionsâ€™ section to include â€˜Design Implicationsâ€™. Here we reflect on the kinds of visitors we think might benefit most from our approach and why. We return to reflect on the social risk inherent in some of the experiences designed, and consider how this could be mitigated in situations where the experience becomes problematic. We also reflect on future challenges, such as how our design workshops might be replaced with an online service and how experiences could be re-used or adapted. \  \ The final point asked us to describe the methodology used to analyse the data. We added a paragraph on â€˜Analysisâ€™ under â€˜Approachâ€™ which describes how we built a rich case study of each pair of participantsâ€™ engagement with our experience from start to finish, and particularly how we adopted an ethnographic approach to analyzing video data.  \  \ To accommodate the additional material we have removed what was previously Figure 1, a visual representation of one participantâ€™s design overlaid on the gallery floorplan. We also reduced the descriptions in Examples 1, 2 and 3. \ ",,Lesley Fosh,Steve Benford,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 12:44,pn1635,A,Transient and Transitional States: Pressure as an Auxiliary Input Modality for Bimanual Interaction,Ross,McLachlan,r.mclachlan.1@research.gla.ac.uk,pn1635-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Ross McLachlan, Daniel Boland, Stephen Brewster","r.mclachlan.1@research.gla.ac.uk, daniel@dcs.gla.ac.uk, stephen.brewster@glasgow.ac.uk",25136,Ross,,McLachlan,r.mclachlan.1@research.gla.ac.uk,School of Computing Science,University of Glasgow,Glasgow,,United Kingdom,,,,,,28927,Daniel,,Boland,daniel@dcs.gla.ac.uk,School of Computing Science,University of Glasgow,Glasgow,,United Kingdom,,,,,,1374,Stephen,,Brewster,stephen.brewster@glasgow.ac.uk,School of Computing Science,University of Glasgow,Glasgow,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A novel investigation of pressure input is presented where it is characterised as a transient modality, one that has a natural inverse, bounce-back and a state that only persists during interaction.

","New Updates. \  \  \ * Explicitly focusing the work on the utility as opposed to the efficiency of pressure in the discussion works great.  However, I feel that this sentiment should be foreshadowed by a similar statement in the introduction under the ""why pressure?"" subsection. \  \  \ Added a statement in the last paragraph of the Why Pressure? Section.  \  \  \  \ * Seeing that you have space, I would also suggest you include the posture aspect as one of you early design constraints.  If you leave them to the end of the paper, they look more like accidents rather than design decisions/delimitations. \  \ Added in ref in opening para of introduction. \  \  \ * Eliminate page numbers for the final draft? \  \ Done. \  \  \  \ * The elimination of paragraph spacing in the introduction has caused awful typesetting on the first page.  Suggest you fix this.  \  \ Done. \  \  \ * Please order all multiple citations in ascending order; on page 3, there are three instances of ""[20, 21, 13]"", which should be ""[13, 20, 21]"".  Please check all other multiple citations as well. \ Done.  \  \  \ * You have an orphaned heading on the second page (""Background"") as well as the fifth page (""Moving""), and there are quite a few widows in general throughout the paper.  For the sake of aesthetics, please try to clean this up.  \  \ Done. \  \  \ =========================================================== \  \ 1. Acknowledgment of the impact of posture. The experiment only \       tested a person sitting down and resting the tablet on their \       legs, but what about standing and walking? The authors will need \       to spend some space discussing the ecological validity and \       utility of their technique in such settings. \  \ This point was addressed by making clear that use in the home, and primarily while seated on the bed or couch, was the motivation for the work and that the results and guidelines are only applicable to this context. A reference was added ([10] in the paper) to support the claim that both the couch and bed are extremely common places for people to use such devices.  \  \  \ 2. A reasonable argument for the utility of pressure selection \       compared to standard touch. What is the overall utility of this \       idea? As the 2AC points out, a user can perform 3-5 taps in the \       time it takes to target a specific pressure. Is this more than a \       theoretical exercise, but one that has real-world utility? We are \       looking for a balanced discussion that acknowledges many of the \       limitations of this idea. \  \ A discussion of this point was included in the General Discussion section. We acknowledge the potential shortcoming of our technique, though state that pressure input has an inherent reversibility (the transient property) that could be useful in design. We state that future work will explore this trade-off between tapping efficiency and transient pressure using realistic applications.  \  \  \  \ 3. Eliminate the Media Navigation example application.  Both the 1AC \       and 2AC took issue with the vagueness of many of the \       applications, and this one in particular seemed rather \       far-fetched. This will also free up some space for other \       improvements. \  \ This example was removed and the Maps example was expanded slightly to include more scenarios. \  \  \  4. Update the design guidelines given the above caveats. These \       guidelines do not take into account the above comments on utility \       in terms of posture as well as selection time compared to taps. \       The authors may need to add additional design guidelines. \  \  \ We felt that with the new emphasis placed on the context as addressed in point 1, which was also stressed in a new sentence prior to the presentation of the guidelines, that they accurately reflect how well users can control pressure and what kind of interactions this could enable. The guidelines state nothing about efficiency (as compared to taps, for instance) but simply state how to use pressure to take advantage of what we call the transient properties. Our definition of transience focuses of reversibility and not efficiency and we feel they accurately reflect what we consider to be the best way to include transient pressure, as we currently understand it, into an interface. We are willing to work on this before the final deadline if necessary. \  \  \  \  5. Improvements in writing, spelling, and any missing references. \       Several reviewers complained about the sloppy state of the work, \       and fixing all of these issues is a clear condition for \       acceptance. \  \  \ The missing reference was added and the grammar, spelling and presentation was tidied up.

We will describe two studies and present design recommendations for encouraging dabbling.","Thank you for conditionally accepting our paper. We have made the following changes, as promised in our rebuttal: \  \ 1) Potential for bias in sample of participants interviewed in Study 2 \  \ We agreed we should provide more details about the final balance of interviewees. On page 5 we added to the Method section: \ ""Potential interviewees were identified according to top and bottom scores on the intrinsic and extrinsic scales in the survey, and high and low contribution records. This cross-sectional recruitment strategy aimed to ensure that the interviews covered a range of contribution levels and a mix of declared motivations. Invitations to participate were sent to respondentsâ€™ email addresses registered with the Zooniverse. Of the 43 respondents contacted, 16 were interviewed and 1 sent a detailed email response. We achieved an approximate balance between low (9) and high (7) contributors. An individual may score highly for both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation simultaneously, or high on one scale and low on the other, or express moderately equal motivations on both scales. Our pool comprised: high extrinsic (4), low extrinsic (4), high intrinsic (3), low intrinsic (1), mixed declared motivations (4). The interviews took place via Skype. Interviews were audio-recorded and varied in length, from 30 minutes to 1 hour. All participants received a gift voucher for taking part."" \  \ We agreed that non-active participants who have an ongoing interest in the project may have featured more strongly in our data pool as a result of self-selection bias than those who had lost all interest, however this does not make their perspective invalid. We modified our discussion of their invisible value to reflect this limitation, see page 9: \ ""There is a likelihood of self-selection bias in Study 2, in that non-active participants with an ongoing interest in the project may have featured more strongly in our data pool than those who had lost all interest. But this does not make their perspective invalid. We suggest that our targeted approach of inviting participants to interview based upon their contributions and motivation scores enabled us to highlight the perspective of a category of volunteers who are overlooked by the usual snowball recruitment strategies."" \  \ 2) Extent to which design recommendations are derived from data and their originality \  \ We proposed that the discussion section could be re-ordered to focus upon those design recommendations which are most directly related to dabbling (e.g. facilitating independent working, given that dabblers mostly work alone) rather than those which might be more generally applicable to crowdsourcing interface design. Our discussion section (pages 8-9) now has 5 design recommendations only:  \ â€¢Facilitate independent working and participant choice \ â€¢Optimize tasks to fit within busy lives  \ â€¢Publicise scientific outcomes \ â€¢Sell citizen science snacks, not gourmet meals! \ â€¢Enable personalized feedback to affirm quality  \  \ We also edited each of these recommendations to embed evidence from the study data, see pages 8-9. \  \ 3) Other concerns \ R3 requested greater definition of terms and clarity of details and R1 requests more background on Old Weather. We wrote that we would incorporate these suggestions and would provide a link to the survey instrument.  \  \ On page 1 we provide dates of the period covered in our study: \ ""We begin by introducing Old Weather - a project that fits a characteristic skewed pattern of participation in citizen science: over the period covered by this study (October 2010 to July 2012), 94% of participants contributed in aggregate 15% of project input."" \  \ On page 2 we provide more details about Old Weatherâ€™s engagement strategy: \ ""Although participation in Old Weather is open to anyone who signs up, a ranking system recognizing the quantity of weather transcriptions made by each volunteer aims to motivate sustained and loyal participation through competition to become â€˜Captainâ€™ of each ship."" \  \ On page 3 we provide a link to our survey â€“ see footnote 1: \ www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic/people/c-jennett/tabs/ow-survey \  \ R2 and R3 recommended that research questions are more precisely tied to the literature. We restructured the lit review accordingly. On page 2 we explain that: \ ""Considering that previous citizen science research tends to concentrate on sustained participation and the positive motivations of high contributors, one goal for our research was to uncover more about casual engagement and factors which discourage participation. Another aim was to investigate the extent to which intrinsic and extrinsic motivations influence both quality and quantity of contributions."" \  \ We also moved our lit review section â€˜Casual Participation: Enablers and Barriersâ€™ to the start of Study 2, as we thought it would be better placed as an introduction to our second study â€“ see page 5: \ ""Only a handful of studies have investigated casual participation in citizen science projects as of yetâ€_""",,Alexandra Eveleigh,Charlene Jennett,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 7:20,pn1651,A,Gesture Script: Recognizing Gestures and their Structure using Rendering Scripts and Interactively Trained Parts,Hao,LÃ_,hlv@cs.washington.edu,pn1651-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Hao LÃ_, James Fogarty, Yang Li","hlv@cs.washington.edu, jfogarty@cs.washington.edu, yangli@acm.org",18383,Hao,,LÃ_,hlv@cs.washington.edu,,University of Washington,Seattle,WA,United States,,Google Research,Mountain View,California,United States,2134,James,,Fogarty,jfogarty@cs.washington.edu,,University of Washington,Seattle,Washington,United States,,,,,,3340,Yang,,Li,yangli@acm.org,,Google Research,Mountain View,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gesture-based interactions have become an essential part of the modern user interface. However, it remains challenging for developers to create gestures for their applications. This paper studies unistroke gestures, an important category of gestures defined by their single-stroke trajectories. We present Gesture Script, a tool for creating unistroke gesture recognizers. Gesture Script enhances example-based learning with interactive declarative guidance through rendering scripts and interactively trained parts. The structural information from the rendering scripts allows Gesture Script to synthesize gesture variations and generate a more accurate recognizer that also automatically extracts gesture attributes needed by applications. The results of our study with developers show that Gesture Script preserves the threshold of familiar example based gesture tools, while raising the ceiling of the recognizers created in such tools.",Paper,Hao LÃ_,ryan.hlv@gmail.com,"1.

A 12-week longitudinal data collection, including surveys and interviews, documents this shift, with participants beginning internships and full-time positions in UX. Students and early professionals were asked to assess their level of competence and factors that influenced competence. A co-construction of identity between the designer and their environment is proposed, with a variety of factors relating to tool and representational knowledge, complexity, and corporate culture influencing perceptions of competence in UX over time.

Using Graffiti as a design meme, we developed a novel social media service  to investigate these issues. A two week field study showed how users incorporated both utilitarian and playful aspects of location into their social media creation, as well as revealing a disconnect between the location-media relationship intended by creators and perceived by viewers.

However, actual or anticipated pain exacerbation, and lack of confidence when doing physical activity, make it difficult to maintain and build towards long-term activity goals. Research guiding the design of interactive technology to motivate and support physical activity in people with chronic pain is lacking. We conducted studies with: (1) people with chronic pain, to understand how they maintained and increased physical activity in daily life and what factors deterred them; and (2) pain-specialist physiotherapists, to understand how they supported people with chronic pain. Building on this understanding, we investigated the use of auditory feedback to address some of the psychological barriers and needs identified and to increase self-efficacy, motivation and confidence in physical activity.

We explore auditory feedback to address these factors and rethink technology for CP.","We have made all the changes detailed in the rebuttal as summarised below: \  \ 1. As advised, we moved the justification of why we sampled both people with CP and physiotherapists to the Introduction section. \  \ 2. We revised the Background section to clarify:  (1) why maintaining physical activity is important for people with CP; (2) how the needs, barriers and strategies for self-management of physical activity in CP differ from the ones of other chronic conditions and hence the need for a technological solution for CP self-management; (3) the role of physiotherapy in CP rehabilitation and the effect that inadequate support has on CP self-management. References to pain literature and existing technology for managing chronic conditions were updated to support these 3 points. \  \ 3. We strengthened the conclusions from Study 1 by revising the Discussion of Findings section. It provides a better synthesis of the main findings and implications for design solutions for CP and also a rationale for the need and aims of Study 2.  \  \ 4. We also strengthened the connection between Study 1 and Study 2 by: (1) changing the title of the section on Study 2 (new title: Rethinking technology for CP rehabilitation); (2) explaining that, rather than designing a game de novo, we aimed first to understand mechanisms (and their effects) for later integration into games or ubiquitous technology for CP; (3) introducing two subsections called â€œDesign Approachâ€ù and â€œDesign Solutionâ€ù to Study 2. \ The â€œDesign Approachâ€ù section explains why we decided to use auditory feedback and what needs and requirements we aimed to address through this type of feedback. The â€œDesign Solutionâ€ù section clarifies how the needs and requirements identified through Study 1 are translated into design solutions.  New literature was introduced to support the use of sound feedback and to justify our solutions.  \  \ 5. We revised the final discussion to focus on the overall lessons learned through Study 1 and Study 2: (1) Designing with an understanding of CP complexity; (2) Pain as threat vs. pain as a message to be reinterpreted; (3) Sound as feedback for CP physical rehabilitation. The discussion is supported by literature on the use of auditory feedback in CP and on run-time active authoring of sound as suggested. \  \ Other points: \ - We added references to apps in the Background section. \ - We specified the overlap of participants in the various studies (see caption of Table 1 and description of participants in study 2). \ -We added details for Study 2 (see design solution and experiment protocol sections): (1) rationale for the selected exercise and how the solution generalizes to other exercises; (2) order of the three conditions was randomized; (3) Figure 2 was improved as suggested.  \ - References were alphabetized \ - The paper was proofread and suggestions to improve readability were incorporated. \  \ These improvements were made through careful rewriting of the above mentioned sections rather than cutting important aspects of the work. \ ",,Aneesha Singh,Nadia Bianchi-Berthouze,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:15,pn1700,A,B#: Chord-based Correction for Multitouch Braille Input,Hugo,Nicolau,hugonicolau@computing.dundee.ac.uk,pn1700-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Hugo Nicolau, Kyle Montague, Tiago Guerreiro, JoÃ£o Guerreiro, Vicki L.

","List of changes \ Supporting the creative game design process with Exertion Cards \  \  \ To the reviewers \ We would like to gratefully thank the reviewers for their detailed feedback, which we have taken to heart in order to improve the paper. Below we have listed the changes made, categorized by section in the rebuttal. We have tried to address the reviewersâ€™ concerns to the best of our abilities and provided additional details where page limits allowed us to do. We thank the reviewers for their contributions. \  \  \ EXTENDING KNOWLEDGE BEYOND PRIOR DESIGN CARD WORK \ Reviewersâ€™ feedback: \ R1 and R2 point out that our paper will benefit from a deeper discussion of how our work extends knowledge from prior work on design cards. \  \ Changes done: \ We added the following statements: \ * Our work is the first specific to exertion games  \ * Our work is the first that explicitly encourages a consideration of trade-offs among the dimensions, extending the notion of trade-offs from cognitive dimensions [e.g. Blackwell & Green (2003). Notational systems - the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. In HCI Models, Theories and Frameworks: Toward a multidisciplinary science. Morgan Kaufmann, 103-134] to design cards. \ * We detail how prior work on design cards offers a coarse view on peopleâ€™s experiences with using the broad themes articulated by a range of cards, whereas our work provides details on the use of individual cards as well as insights on each cardâ€™s role in the design process. This offers designers of future cards structured guidance on the design of each individual card. \ * We present detailed challenges when designing with cards; this is an aspect that many prior works appear to neglect or report on only briefly.  \  \ PROCESS AND METHOD \ Reviewersâ€™ feedback: \ R2 wanted to know more about the process and method how we turned the framework into cards. \  \ Changes done: \ We added the following: \ * We structured the process into groupings, generating abstract high-level, generalizable concepts that will help guide future attempts to operationalize theory into design practice \ * Our work is the first that provides insights into how theory can be turned into design cards in contrast to prior research that tended to focus on the design of theory as cards.  \  \ DATA COLLECTION \ Reviewersâ€™ feedback: \ R2 wanted to hear more about the method we employed to collect data. 	 \  \ Changes done: \ We added the following: \ * We articulated how video was taken per workshop and team. \ * We detailed how we analyzed this data [Strauss & Corbin (1998). Basics of Qualitative Research: Techniques and Procedures for Developing Grounded Theory. SAGE]. \ * We discussed the implications of our findings with respect to the diversity of our participant cohort, which consisted of researchers and students. We highlighted how the design of the cards supported different objectives and expectations for the participants based on their expertise levels. \   \  \ REFERENCES TO EXISTING CREATIVITY RESEARCH \ Reviewersâ€™ feedback: \ R1 suggested adding relevant supporting literature. \  \ Changes done: \ We explained how our paper relates to other prior work that aimed to translate theory into practice, particularly drawing from the creativity research domain as suggested by the reviewers.  \  \ ",games,Florian Mueller,Darren Edge,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 8:59,pn1710,A,Everyday Ideation: All of My Ideas Are On Pinterest,Rhema,Linder,rhema@ecologylab.net,pn1710-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Rhema Linder, Clair Snodgrass, Andruid Kerne","rhema@ecologylab.net, clair@ecologylab.net, andruid@ecologylab.net",30053,Rhema,,Linder,rhema@ecologylab.net,Interface Ecology Lab,Texas A&M University,College Station,Texas,United States,,,,,,38251,Clair,,Snodgrass,clair@ecologylab.net,Interface Ecology Lab,Texas A&M University,College Station,Texas,United States,,,,,,3309,Andruid,,Kerne,andruid@ecologylab.net,Interface Ecology Lab,Texas A&M University,College Station,Texas,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We develop new understanding of how people engage in digital curation.

Research with virtual agents and robots has started to add to the scientific knowledge about gestures but many questions with respect to the use of gestures in human-computer interaction are still open. This paper investigates the influence of robot gestures on the users' perceived workload and task performance (i.e. information recall) in a direction-giving task. We conducted a 2 x 2 (robot gestures vs. no robot gestures x easy vs. difficult task) experiment.  \ The results indicate that robot gestures increased user performance and decreased perceived workload in the difficult task \\textit{but} not in the easy task.

By monitoring advice seeking behavior, our first experiment demonstrates that if participants observe an avatar at an oblique viewing angle on a flat display, they are less able to discriminate between expert and non-expert advice than if they observe the avatar face-on. We then introduce a novel spherical display and a ray-traced rendering technique that can display an avatar that can be seen correctly from any viewing direction. We expect that a spherical display has advantages over a flat display because it better supports non-verbal cues, particularly gaze direction, since it presents a clear and undistorted viewing aspect at all angles. Our second experiment compares the spherical display to a flat display. Whilst participants can discriminate expert advice regardless of display, a negative bias towards the flat screen emerges at oblique viewing angles. This result emphasizes the ability of the spherical display to be viewed qualitatively similarly from all angles. Together the experiments demonstrate how trust can be altered depending on how one views the avatar.",Paper,Ye Pan,y.pan@cs.ucl.ac.uk,"1. Andrist, S., Pejsa, T., Mutlu, B., and Gleicher, M.

We have addressed all the points in the reviews and rebuttal. P = Page; R = reviewer.   \  \ 1. The link between expertise and trust: \ As R2 suggested, we added a description of â€œIncentives & riskâ€ù (See P6). \   \ As R1 suggested, we added a description of the link among trust, interpersonal cues and expertise in second paragraph of evacuation design section (See P5). We reinforced related work with further evidence: [3] and [30]. Also we added a more detailed description of [26] (see P2). \  \ We used more precise presentation in the abstract and introduction: Instead of claiming that we have measured trust directly, we stated that we have measured advice seeking behaviour. Also, Instead of claiming advice-seeking behaviour could be interpreted as trust, we stated that advice-seeking behaviour could be seen as an indicator of trust. \  \ 2. The description of the experiments:  \ We described the two experiments separately, as suggested. \  \ We added the description of moderating the novelty effect in experiment 2 method section (see P7).  \  \ We modified previous Fig 9 to show how advice seeking occurred over time (see Fig 7(c)). \  \ We addressed the description of the counterbalancing of the display positions in experiment 2 method section (see P7). \  \ As per R1, we added a more detailed description about participantsâ€™ â€œthe median ageâ€ù and â€œprevious experienceâ€ù. \  \ As R1 & R3 suggested, we combined multiple correlated items into larger scales with confirmatory factor analysis for the self-report measures in the experiment 2 result section (P8).  \  \ As per R2, we added a discussion about quantitatively evaluate gaze of participants (P10). \  \ As per R2, we removed ""deixis"" in the abstract, presented data with high contrast colour & changed the corresponding text (see Fig 7) and mentioned ""repeated measures"". \  \ As per R3, we described the procedure chronologically in the experiment 1 method section. \  \ As per R3, we add a description of â€œour system can record and render facial expression in real-timeâ€ù (see P5).  \  \ As per R3, we modified Fig 5 by using three different colours to depict the physical layout of three the spatial arrangement conditions (see P6). We removed previous Fig 8(c).  \  \ We have also fixed all the minor issues, as suggested.  \ Thank you again for all your time. \  \ Faithfully, \ The authors \ ",IxSc,Ye Pan,William Steptoe,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 19:24,pn1732,A,"How Technology Supports Family Communication in Rural, Suburban, and Urban Kenya",Erick,Oduor,eoduor@sfu.ca,pn1732-paper.pdf,10,letter,"Arial Times_New_Roman Arial,Bold Times_New_Roman,Bold Times_New_Roman,Italic Arial,Italic Helvetica,Bold",,"Erick Oduor, Carman Neustaedter, Tejinder K.

Our work builds on this. We present results from an exploratory qualitative study on the family communication practices of family members who communicate both within and between rural, suburban, and urban settings in Kenya. Our findings reveal that family communication focuses on economic support, well-being, life advice, and everyday coordination of activities.  We also outline social factors that affect family communication, including being an eldest child, having a widowed sibling, and having reduced access to technology because of gender, literacy, or oneâ€™s financial situation. Lastly, we discuss new opportunities for technology design and articulate the challenges that designers will face if creating or deploying family communication technologies in Kenya.",Paper,Erick Oduor,eoduor@sfu.ca,"1.

We conducted an experiment with 69 children between the ages of 4 and 10 years to investigate how they might engage in conversation differently if their interactive partner appeared as a cartoon character or as a person.  A subset of the participants interacted with characters that displayed exaggerated and damped facial motion.  The children completed two conversations with an adult confederate who appeared once as herself through video and once as a cartoon character. We measured how much the children spoke and compared their gaze and gesture patterns.  We asked them to rate their conversations and indicate their preferred partner.  There was no difference in children's conversation behavior with the cartoon character and the person on video, even among those who preferred the person and when the cartoon exhibited altered motion.

This paper presents an evaluation of a game-based approach seeking to improve the road safety behaviour amongst children aged 9-15 within the UK, made available outside of a classroom context as an online, browser-based, free-to-play game. The paper reports on data for 99,683 players over 315,882 discrete logins, supplemented by results from a nationally-representative survey of children at UK schools (n=1,108), an incentivized survey of the player-base (n=1,028), and qualitative data obtained through a series of one-to-one interviews aged 9-14 (n=28). Analysis demonstrates the reach of the game to its target demographic, with 88.13% of players within the UK. A 3.94 male/female ratio was observed amongst players surveyed, with an age distribution across the target range of 9-15. Noting mean and median playtimes of 93 and 31 minutes (n=99,683), it is suggested such an approach to user engagement and retention can surpass typical contact times obtained through other forms of web-based content. The size of the player-base attracted to the game and players' qualitative feedback demonstrates the potential for serious games deployed on a national scale.",Paper,Ian Dunwell,dunwell.i@gmail.com,"1.

The relevant section on the design of the game has been expanded, with key research questions underlying the design approach made more evident throughout the section. This has occupies most of the remaining space available for the paper, which is now at the 10-page limit. \  \ 3) The paper's contribution to HCI research has been clarified with a minor amendment to the abstract, and through the linkage of the research questions identified in the design section to the results and conclusions section. The uniqueness of this study in terms of scale and evidence of a serious game reaching a national audience has also been made more clear, in-line with reviewer recommendations. \  \ 4) Additional data from qualitative work looking across the sample has been added to the start of the relevant section. As noted here, the limited scale of this aspect of the research limits attempt to quantitatively analyse this smaller sample in a meaningful fashion, and hence greater linkage to quantitative data from the larger-scale survey activities has been added in this section to reinforce the findings. \  \ 5) Amendments and additions to the discussion and conclusions have also been made to strengthen and clarify the contribution of the paper to HCI \  \ 6) In the rebuttal, we noted supplemental data on route-in was available; space limitations precluded including this as a Figure, though text has been added in the second paragraph of ""Uptake and Reach"" reporting this data.",games,Ian Dunwell,Panagiotis Petridis,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 14:47,pn1756,A,Quantitative Measurement of Virtual vs. Physical Object Embodiment through Kinesthetic Figural After Effects,Ayman,Alzayat,zayat85@gmail.com,pn1756-paper.pdf,10,letter,Not_a_PDF_file,,"Ayman Alzayat, Mark Hancock, Miguel Nacenta","aalzayat@uwaterloo.ca, mark.hancock@uwaterloo.ca, mans@st-andrews.ac.uk",38291,Ayman,,Alzayat,aalzayat@uwaterloo.ca,Department of Management Sciences,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,5952,Mark,,Hancock,mark.hancock@uwaterloo.ca,Department of Management Sciences,University of Waterloo,Waterloo,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,6171,Miguel,,Nacenta,mans@st-andrews.ac.uk,,University of St Andrews,St Andrews,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Over the past decade, multi-touch surfaces have become commonplace, with many researchers and practitioners describing the benefits of their natural, physical-like interactions.

The game collects detailed S3D player metrics and allows players to choose between different, evenly matched strategies. We conducted a between subjects study comparing S3D and monoscopic versions of Deepress3D that examined player behavior and performance and measured user-reported data on presence, simulator sickness, and game experience. Confirming previous results, stereo users reported higher spatial presence. More importantly, for the first time, our game metrics indicate that S3D vision can measurably change player behavior depending on actual game content and level design, without necessarily affecting performance or emotional experience.

This was revealed through evaluating an S3D-specific game which supports multiple gameplay strategies. Spatial presence was furthermore increased.,"We again thank the PC for pushing towards substantially clarifying significance of our contribution and on better communicating the importance for the general HCI community. \  \ In this regard we significantly adjusted abstract, introduction and related work to better reflect the general motivational causal chain and the actual contribution of our paper over previous work. As proposed in the rebuttal it now highlights the aspect of how users behave differently with stereo 3D in terms of what they do and how they act in contrast to previous expectations that we just performing better doing the same things. Examining this novel aspect is now much more in focus, and analyzed using an S3D-specific game that provides multiple player strategies and examines state-of-the-art benefits of stereo 3D by incorporating latest previous findings. Using the game for a detailed analysis of gameplay through integrated metrics and comparable self-reporting tools is a novel and holistic approach.  \  \ The introduction was rewritten to reflect this optimization. Related work was adjusted mostly in the order of references and the structure or reasoning. We have further clarified that aspect in the Deepress3d section which now does not confuse anymore the importance of the multiple player strategies with the two perspectives which are only of minor importance. We have also adjusted discussion and conclusion sections to reflect these corrections as well. \  \ As to the two perspectives, we have changed the wording of the ego centric perspective to behind-view. We have added more information on the fixed order of the two views in the mixed-design. \  \ We changed H1 to expect higher immersion in game experience as found in [18]. We changed H5 to match the improved focus on gameplay strategies and added more explanations to the other hypotheses. \  \ We added to Section Depth-cue deluding the details that our delusions are applied in both vision modes and are not as strong as previously proposed illusions and emphasized on this aspect better in the related work section. \  \ We removed proposing our game as superior. We added texture pattern frequency to Section Depth-Cue deluding. We added display model, lighting setting with visible screen border, resolution and S3D format to apparatus section.

To date, there has been no systematic attempt to understand the effectiveness of existing tools, or explore what users really require to build successful ontologies. Here we address this shortfall, presenting insights from an interview study with 15 ontology authors. We identify the problems reported by authors, and the strategies they employ to solve them. We map the data to a set of design recommendations, which describe how tools of the future can support ontology authoring.

Using mechanical turk as experimental platform, we asked users to evaluate pairs of videos, and compared users' relative perception of the videos' content against their relative popularity  reported by YouTube. We found that in most evaluations users could not reach consensus on which video had better content as their perceptions tend to be very subjective. Nevertheless, when consensus was reached, the video with preferred content almost always achieved greater popularity on YouTube, highlighting the importance of content in driving information popularity on social media.",Note,Flavio Figueiredo,flaviov@dcc.ufmg.br,"1.

We changed the title of the note. Our new title is: ""Does Content Determine Information Popularity in Social Media? A Case Study of YouTube Videosâ€™ Content and their Popularity"". This new title is more aligned with our study and address the concerns of Reviewer 2 (R2). \  \ 2. We softened our claims on the results of prior works. This is reflected in the second paragraph of the Introduction section. More importantly, we added a whole paragraph contrasting our work with the one by Salganik et al. This discussion is on the last paragraph of the Introduction section. We have also added the suggested references by the reviewers. With such changes we address the concerns on prior work by R3 and Meta Reviewer (MR). \  \ 3. We better explained our experimental methodology section. In details we have: \  \   3a. We better highlighted the existence of two neutral options users could choose from. This change addresses the concerns of R3 and MR. It can be found on the subsection Human Intelligence Tasks (last paragraph). \  \   3b. On the same paragraph, we also added a discussion on the cost of our task on mechanical turk, plus how long users took to perform these tasks. These concerns were raised by R5. \  \ 4. We better explained our results, such as pointing out how many times users chose a neutral answer. These changes can be found in the ""Can users reach consensus?"" section.  \  \ 5. We added a discussion of the practical significance of our results in the Discussion section. This is followed by a paragraph in which discuss the representativeness of our experiments. We also highlight that we have made all of our source code and datasets available online. With these changes we address the concerns of R2, R3, R5 and MR. \  \ Finally we point out that the changes above are directly aligned with the text we presented in the rebuttal letter. More importantly, instead of removing content to make space for new text, we mostly focused on cosmetic changes (e.g., we merged two tables) and on better summarizing previous text. \ ",,Flavio Figueiredo,Krishna Gummadi,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:40,pn1773,A,PitchPerfect: Integrated Rehearsal Environment for Structured Presentation Preparation,Ha,Trinh,htt121286@gmail.com,pn1773-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Ha Trinh, Koji Yatani, Darren Edge","htt121286@gmail.com, koji@microsoft.com, darren.edge@microsoft.com",36818,Ha,,Trinh,htt121286@gmail.com,,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,,China,School of Computing,University of Dundee,Dundee,Scotland,United Kingdom,9633,Koji,,Yatani,koji@microsoft.com,,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,Beijing,China,,,,,,9574,Darren,,Edge,darren.edge@microsoft.com,,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,Beijing,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rehearsal is a critical component of preparing to give an oral presentation, yet it is frequently abbreviated, performed in ways that are inefficient or ineffective, or simply omitted.

While previous research has focused on understanding specific elements of the overall vision, our work presents details of the first significant attempt at a system that integrates future pervasive display networks and mobile devices to support display personalisation. We describe a series of usage models and design goals for display personalisation and then present Tacita, a system that supports these models and goals. Our architecture includes mobile, display and cloud-based elements and provides comprehensive personalisation features while preventing the creation of user profiles within the display infrastructure, thus helping to preserve users' privacy. An initial evaluation of our prototype implementation of the architecture is also included and demonstrates the viability of the Tacita approach. ",Paper,Sarah Clinch,s.clinch@comp.lancs.ac.uk,"1.

The approximation of objects with points allows us to transform the labeling problem to graph layout problem, which we solve by means of force-based algorithm. The input parameters allow us to influence the resulting layout of label boxes (e.g. to adapt their distance for imprecise input devices). In a study with 15 participants two implementations of our algorithm were compared against labeling method, where all label boxes share the same offset from corresponding objects. The results of the study show that implementation using a special functionality (temporary freezing of the label box position recalculation) was 14% faster with a comparable accuracy. The subjective evaluation revealed that the implementation with temporary freezing  is perceived as most comfortable, fastest and most accurate.

Thirdly, it examines how visuo-spatial factors influence navigation. We believe that our findings will be useful for designing navigation systems for bikes and even for cars, helping cyclists and drivers be more attentive to their environment while navigating, and to provide useful information while moving. \ ",Note,Alexandru Dancu,alexandru.dancu@gmail.com,"1.

Social technologies offer enormous potential for enhancing aged care, but research on their use in aged care has largely focused on institutional or informal care settings, rather than formal care in the home. Meanwhile, technologies for aging in place typically focus on monitoring and security, rather than psychosocial support. We conducted a field study in which aged care managers used a photo and message-sharing tool to communicate with clients living in their own homes. Our findings demonstrate that visual and social forms of communication are valuable for supporting psychosocial care-giving, but there are barriers to effectively adopting new communication tools in this setting. Time constraints inhibited care managersâ€™ use of the technology, which was also influenced by their efforts to carefully maintain boundaries between their personal and professional lives.

Social technologies in formal care introduce challenges, requiring work to maintain boundaries between personal and professional lives.  ","We have made the following changes to our CHI 2014 submission, in accordance with the Associate Chairâ€™s requests. \  \ The title has been changed to: â€œCaptioned Photographs in Psychosocial Aged Care: Relationship Building and Boundary Workâ€ù to reflect that the paper is not strictly about photo-sharing, but a study on text message captioning of photographs. We have also reduced the discussion of background literature about photo-sharing. \  \ The committee requested that the barriers faced by carers in adopting the technology must be highlighted as a contribution to the field. We have made some changes to the abstract to emphasise barriers to adoption as a key finding of our research and have added a subheading in the Discussion section titled â€œBarriers and Challengesâ€ù to make it clearer that this is a significant contribution of our research. \  \ In response to the request for a more detailed analysis of the barriers to using the iPad, especially given that three care managers used it very little, we have presented additional information in the Discussion (under the subheading â€œBarriers and Challengesâ€ù) about why there was limited use by those care managers, and noted that one of the limitations of the study is that it was not fully integrated into care managersâ€™ work life.  \  \ At the end of the section titled â€œTechnology-Supported Aged Careâ€ù we have added a paragraph justifying our decision to focus on care workersâ€™ experiences in this paper, in response to the request for a stronger argument to explain and justify this focus.  \  \ In the section titled â€œData Collection and Analysisâ€ù we have added further details about the methods used in the evaluation and how the data were analysed, with a reference to support this.  \  \ To emphasise the Australian context and carersâ€™ profession, in the section titled â€œTechnology-Supported Aged Careâ€ù we have added the following statements: â€œOur research takes place in Australiaâ€ù and â€œCare managers may come from a variety of professional backgrounds, including nursing, but in this role they are employed as aged care professionals, rather than nurses.â€ù We have also added an additional reference that provides further information about the professional role of care (case) managers in aged care.  \  \ We have added a statement at the end of the Discussion section to clarify that our findings show unique patterns of use, relating to unique partnerships between care managers and clients, to clarify that we did not compare users as if they were the same and did not intend to generalize from our data.  \  \ We have made minor edits to the wording in the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion sections to avoid giving the impression that we have evidence suggesting the technology enhanced clientsâ€™ experience of care. Where appropriate, we have changed the term â€œpsychosocial careâ€ù to â€œpsychosocial care-givingâ€ù to emphasise that we focus on the activity of care-giving, rather than the experience of care. \  \ We have added a sentence with a citation to earlier research that describes the iPad application in more detail.  \  \ A paragraph has been added under the new heading â€œCaptioned Photographs and Messagesâ€ù to explain our decision to use a purpose-built tool.  \ In response to the suggestion by R4, we have added a reference to the paper by Webster et al (2011).  \  \ Finally, in order to make space for the revisions requested, we have done additional editing throughout the document. We amalgamated two subsections so there is now one background section titled â€œTechnology-Supported Aged Careâ€ù. The Discussion section has been restructured and edited for clarity, and we have removed some extraneous references. \ ",,Frank Vetere,Jenny Waycott,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 17:28,pn1806,A,Curation through Use: Understanding the Personal Value of Social Media,Xuan,Zhao,xuanzhao@umich.edu,pn1806-paper.pdf,10,letter,"Arial,Bold Times_New_Roman,Bold Times_New_Roman Times_New_Roman,Italic Arial,Italic Arial Helvetica",,"Xuan Zhao, SiÃ¢n Lindley","xuanzhao@umich.edu, sianl@microsoft.com",16348,Xuan,,Zhao,xuanzhao@umich.edu,School of Information,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,Michigan,United States,,,,,,2278,SiÃ¢n,,Lindley,sianl@microsoft.com,,Microsoft Research,Cambridge,Cambridgeshire,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Content generation on social network sites has been considered mainly from the perspective of individuals interacting with social network contacts. Yet research has also pointed to the potential for social media to become a meaningful personal archive over time. The aim of this paper is to consider how social media, over time and across sites, forms part of the wider digital archiving space for individuals. Our findings, from a qualitative study of 14 social media users, highlight how although some sites are more associated with â€˜keepableâ€™ social media than others, even those are not seen as archives in the usual sense of the word. We show how this perception is bound up with five contradictions, which center on social media as curated, as a reliable repository of meaningful content, as readily encountered and as having the potential to present content as a compelling narrative. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for design relating to curation through use and what this implies for personal digital archives, which are known to present difficulties in terms of curation and re-finding.",Paper,Xuan Zhao,xuanzhao@umich.edu,"1.

In face-to-face support groups, health professionals facilitate peer-patients exchanging experience while adding their clinical expertise when necessary. However, the large scale of online health communities makes it challenging for such health professional moderatorsâ€™ involvement to happen. To address this challenge of delivering clinical expertise to where patients need them, we explore the idea of semi-automatically providing clinical expertise in online health communities. We interviewed 14 clinicians showing them example peer-patient conversation threads. From the interviews, we examined the ideal practice of clinicians providing expertise to patients. The clinicians continuously assessed when peer-patients were providing appropriate support, what kinds of clinical help they could give online, and when to defer to patientsâ€™ healthcare providers.

We introduce the term ""mobile attachment"" and define it as a bond between a person's self and a mobile phone that varies in strength. Based on a critical reflection of interdisciplinary literature, a conceptual mobile attachment model is developed. Within this model causes, consequences and influencing factors of mobile attachment are exposed and elaborated. We argue that mobile attachment emerges when the mobile phone becomes part of the user's self concept. The link between the user and their mobile phone may be fostered when it empowers, enriches, or gratifies the user's self. Attachment causes lead to ""design space determinants"" that enable user experience designers to design for mobile attachment.

Our findings lead to recommendations for event-oriented promotion tools; community-oriented analytics; tangible and embedded products; and limited-edition digital experiences.

We have also acknowledged in the discussion section on page 8 (Recommendation 2: Community-oriented analytics paragraph) how we have generalised from a small sample of connected musicians.  \ â€¢	In response to R2â€™s comments, we have extended the discussion of â€˜handcrafted limited-edition experiencesâ€™, acknowledging that professionals also utilise limited edition physical packaging, but that the option of handcrafting these is particularly relevant to amateurs working at a micro-scale who may employ the approach to create personal relationships with individual fans. We have added an additional recommendation about the possibility of harvesting fine-grained feedback through future handcrafted artifacts. \ â€¢	We have strengthened the links between our data and design recommendations by punctuating each of the appropriate sections in the Findings (Page 4: Being part of a community section, 2nd paragraph; Page 5: Material and handcrafted distribution section, 4th paragraph; Page 7: Scheduling online promotion section, 2nd paragraph; Page 7: The hard work of online promotion section, 1st paragraph) with forward references to design implications as recommended.  \ â€¢	We have rewritten our recommendation on community-oriented analytics to clarify the potential functionality of future services. \ â€¢	We have made space for these changes by removing Figure 1 (page 4) and Figure 5 (page 7) as suggested by Reviewer 1.","cultures, artIx",Michaela Hoare,Steve Benford,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 17:30,pn1845,A,Social Fabric Fitness: The Design and Evaluation of Wearable E-Textile Displays to Support Group Running,Jon,Froehlich,jonfroehlich@gmail.com,pn1845-paper.pdf,10,letter,,incomplete,"Matthew Mauriello, Michael Gubbels, Jon Froehlich","mattm@cs.umd.edu, mgubbels@umd.edu, jonf@cs.umd.edu",25499,Matthew,,Mauriello,mattm@cs.umd.edu,Computer Science,University of Maryland,College Park,Maryland,United States,,,,,,29874,Michael,,Gubbels,mgubbels@umd.edu,Human-Computer Interaction Lab,University of Maryland,College Park,MD,United States,,,,,,6165,Jon,,Froehlich,jonf@cs.umd.edu,,University of Maryland,College Park,Maryland,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Group exercise has multiple benefits including greater adherence to fitness regimens, increased enjoyment among participants, and enhanced workout intensity. While a large number of technology tools have emerged to support real-time feedback of individual performance, tools to support group fitness are limited. In this paper, we present a set of wearable e-textile displays for running groups called Social Fabric Fitness (SFF). SFF provides a glanceable, shared screen on the back of the wearerâ€™s shirt to increase awareness and motivation of group fitness performance. We discuss parallel prototyping of three designsâ€”one flexible e-ink and two flexible LED-based displays; the selection and refinement of one design; and two evaluationsâ€”a field study of 10 running groups and two case studies of running races. Our qualitative findings indicate that SFF improves awareness of individual and group performance, helps groups stay together, and improves in-situ motivation.

InkAnchor incorporates flexible anchoring, focus-plus-context input, content chunking, and lightweight editing mechanisms to support the capture of informal notes and annotations.

Previous studies of ASR have focused on how transcripts aid NNS speech comprehension. In this study, we examine whether transcripts benefit multiparty real-time conversation between NS and NNS. We hypothesized that ASR transcripts would be more beneficial when the transcripts were publicly shared by all group members as opposed to when they were seen only by the NNS. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a lab experiment in which 14 groups of native and non-native speakers engaged in a story-telling task. Half of the groups received private transcripts that were available only to the NNS; the other half received publicly shared transcripts that were available to all group members. NS spoke more clearly, and both NS and NNS rated the quality of communication higher, when transcripts were publicly shared.

Here we list all revisions we did on the paper based on your comments. \   \ Captions for Figure1 and Table1: Both R1 and AC suggested that the captions for Figure1 (p.2) and Table1 (p.4) should be clearer. In this revision, we made more detailed description of the contents of Figure1 and Table1 by refining the captions.  \  \ Clarifications on Experiment Settings: As requested by R1, we clarified in the revision that all editings observed and analyzed in this study were corrections rather than adding notes (p.5).  \  \ Design Implications: Both R2 and AC expected to see more discussion on how our findings could inspire the design of future ASR systems. To address these concerns and strengthen the design implication section (p.9), we added a new paragraph showing how to make the layout of ASR interface more friendly to NNS users based on our findings.  \  \ External Validity: As requested by R1, AC and secondary AC, we discussed the external validity of our findings in the section of limitation and future direction (p.9). In this newly added section, we discussed what type of collaboration task in the real world is resembled by the story telling tasked used in this study. Also, we pointed out some future works to be done based on the current study.  \  \ Additional Fixes. We also fixed typos as suggested by R3 and AC.  \  \ Thanks again for all the thoughtful comments.

The concept of documentscape refers to the entire ensemble of documents in their mutual intertextual interlocking. Providing empirical data from a global software development case, we show how hierarchical structures and sequentiality across the interlocked documents are critical to how actors make sense of the work of others and what to do next in a geographically distributed setting. Furthermore, we found that while each document is created as part of a quasi-sequential order, this characteristic does not make the document, as a single entity, into a stable object. Instead, we found that the documents were malleable and dynamic while suspended in intertextual structures. Our concept of documentscape points to how the hierarchical structure, sequentiality, and authorless nature of documents serve as a constitutive platform for the development of iterative and emergent work practices, making it possible for highly distributed actors to collaborate with limited communication, as the documentscape serves as a vehicle of coordination.

We identify that the gesture/use-case pairings proposed by interaction designers are often driven by factors relating improved tangibility, spatial directionality and strong metaphorical bonds. With this starting point, we argue that some of the designs may not make use of the full potential of deformation gestures as continuous, bipolar input techniques. In two user studies, we revisited the basics of deformation input by taking a new systematic look at the question of matching gestures with use cases. We observed comparable levels of UX when using bend input in different continuous bipolar interactions, irrespective of the choice of tangibility, directionality and metaphor. We concluded that device bend gestures use their full potential when used to control continuous bipolar parameters, and when quick reactions are needed. From our studies, we also identify relative strengths of absolute and relative mappings, and report a Fittsâ€™ law study for device bending input.",Paper,Teemu Ahmaniemi,teemu.ahmaniemi@nokia.com,"1.

Our research covers a full design process including a qualitative-empirical pre-study, the prototyping process and the investigation of long-term appropriation processes of the stable prototypes in three different practice environments. Specifically, we deal with the problem of â€˜wanderingâ€™ by persons suffering from late-phase dementia. Although GPS tracking is not a novel technological objective, the usage of those systems in dementia care remains very low. The paper therefore takes a socio-technical stance on development and appropriation of GPS technology in dementia care and assesses the practical and ideological issues surrounding care to understand why. We additionally provide design research in two different settings, familial and institutional care, and report on the design of a GPS-based tracking system reflecting these considerations.

The assists worked well in a target-range scenario (study 1), but their performance was reduced when game elements were introduced in a walkthrough map (study 2). We systematically examined the relationships between realistic game elements and assist performance (study 3). These studies show that two techniques â€“ bullet magnetism and area cursor â€“ worked well in a wide variety of situations. Other techniques that worked well were too perceptible, and some previously-successful techniques did not work well in any game-like scenario.

In particular, the discussion has been rewritten to provide deeper analysis on a variety of topics in place of some the quotes in the previous version. Specifically, we include and expand on many of the themes from our rebuttal, including a deeper discussion of the ecosystems that enable and constrain high-tech DIY practice, the different paths through DIY practice, the relationship between prototyping and production, and the way that technology affects DIY's relevance and tools, and notions of transparency. The conclusion now directly addresses the relationship between DIY and empowerment, again in accordance with the reviewer comments. The introduction has been revised to reflect these changes in the discussion and the conclusion -- and, therefore, to more directly discuss the issues of interest to the reviewers.

Users often hold objects and use mobile devices at the same time and we examined the impact encumbrance has on one- and two- handed interactions.  Three common input postures were evaluated: two-handed index finger, one-handed preferred thumb and two-handed both thumbs, to assess the effects on performance of carrying a bag in each hand while walking.  The results showed a significant decrease in targeting performance when users were encumbered.  For example, input accuracy dropped to 48.1% for targeting with the index finger when encumbered, while targeting error using the preferred thumb to input was 4.2mm, an increase of 40% compared to unencumbered input.  We also introduce a new method to evaluate the userâ€™s preferred walking speed when interacting - PWS&I, and suggest future studies should use this to get a more accurate measure of the userâ€™s input performance.

These are complex sociotechnical issues, bound up in infrastructures based on problematic ideologies. In response, we worked with a coalition of Wikipedians to design, develop, and deploy Snuggle, a new user interface that served two critical functions: making the work of newcomer socialization more effective, and bringing visibility to instances in which Wikipediansâ€™ current practice of gatekeeping socialization breaks down. Snuggle supports positive socialization by helping mentors quickly find newcomers whose good-faith mistakes were reverted as damage. Snuggle also supports ideological critique and reflection by bringing visibility to the consequences of viewing newcomers through a lens of suspiciousness.",Paper,Aaron Halfaker,aaron.halfaker@gmail.com,"1.

With an emphasis on fostering social connection and physical activity among older people, this preliminary study investigated objects that people over the age of 65 years viewed as significant to them. We conducted contextual interviews in peopleâ€™s homes about their significant objects in order to understand the role of the objects in their lives, the extent to which they fostered emotional and social connections and physical activity, and how they might be augmented through internet connection. \  \ Discussion of significant objects generated considerable emotion in the participants. We identified objects of comfort and routine, objects that exhibited status, those that fostered independence and connection, and those that symbolized relationships with loved ones.

They are here selected for an ethnographic study since their continuous content generation can teach us something of what it takes for amateurs, who currently struggle with mastering the video medium, to become proficient producers. We learn from media theory that Pro-Ams are distinguished from professionals in terms of inherent skills and identities, and have therefore focused on these characteristics. We add to this research by showing on-going challenges that the former face in their production, i.e. how their learning practices, such as learning through instructions, are situated and related to particular settings. Learning and development of skills were done as organizations, rather than as individuals. Furthermore, the recurrent nature of both events and broadcasts appears to be an important condition for establishing the terms needed to carry out a production, and to learn the skills of a producer. This understanding may explain in part why accounts in previous research, of single users struggling with the affordances of live video, point to such diffiÂ¬culties in mastering the medium. The findings guide design to better support activities contiguous with the set-up of the production, rather than the broadcast per se. ",Paper,Oskar Juhlin,oskarj@dsv.su.se,"1.

Our design exploration pays particular attention to areas of the touch surface that were previously overlooked: out of handâ€™s reach and close to the floor.

Opening claim of introduction was reformulated to correctly address the contribution of the paper. It now reads: ""how to facilitate interaction with the lower region of touch displays, which is beyond hand-reach?""Âù Further on this note, we removed ""not previously accessible to its users"" (on related work section, feet input).  \  \ 2. Added an ergonomic reference [3] to sustain our claim that bending down is not ideal for close interaction.  \  \ 3.

As a part of this trend, visualizations have gained great popularity among players, in particular heatmaps since they allow them to reenact the course of a game and to develop new strategies. In this paper we report results of a user study conducted with 29 players (i) to investigate how players use heatmaps and two further graphical representations that use clustering algorithms to interpret gameplay and (ii) to assess the three representations in regard to time efficiency, correctness, suitability, and player preference. Our results show that heatmaps were mainly used to detect hot spots while the cluster representations proved useful to compare variables, allowing the players to uncover relationships between them and in turn allowing a deeper insight into the gameplay data.

This guided the practical design to be modelled around open-endedness and social voices to challenge ideas and points of view. We argue that research addressing design for interactions about value-laden concepts such as sustainable action need to find ways of supporting various knowledge discourses, by distinguishing between performative and representational technologies.

We propose a low-cost cylindrical videoconferencing system that preserves gaze direction by providing perspective-correct images for multiple viewpoints around a conference table. We accomplish this by using an array of cameras to capture a remote person, and an array of projectors to present the camera images onto a cylindrical screen. The cylindrical screen reflects each image to a narrow viewing zone. The use of such a situated display allows participants to see the remote person from multiple viewing directions.

Assessing a personâ€™s driving style is a useful way to guide aggressive drivers toward having safer driving behaviors. A number of studies have investigated driving style, but they often rely on the use of self-reports or simulators, which are not suitable for the real-time, continuous, automated assessment and feedback on the road. In order to understand and model aggressive driving style, we construct an in-vehicle sensing platform that uses a smartphone instead of using heavyweight, expensive systems. Utilizing additional cheap sensors, our sensing platform can collect useful information about vehicle movement, maneuvering and steering wheel movement. We use this data and apply machine learning to build a driver model that evaluates driversâ€™ driving styles based on a number of driving-related features. From a naturalistic data collection from 22 drivers for 3 weeks, we analyzed the characteristics of drivers who have an aggressive driving style. Our model classified those drivers with an accuracy of 90.5% (violation-class) and 81% (questionnaire-class). We describe how, in future work, our model can be used to provide real-time feedback to drivers using only their current smartphone.

We began by running an evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk with over 27,000 respondents to test the usability of different feature combinations. Then we studied user preferences using Google's consumer survey infrastructure. Finally, drawing on the insights gleaned during those studies, we tested our new captcha schemes first on Mechanical Turk and then on a fraction of production traffic.

However, there are few descriptions of projects that have been successful in the long-term. In this paper we investigate what factors are important for developing long lasting community ICT interventions. We do this by analysing a successful action research project and provide five recommendations for facilitating sustained community engagement. CrowdMemo aimed to preserve local heritage in a town in rural Argentina and the project was set up so that it could be continued by the community once researchers had left. Participants created videos about personal memories of the town and over 600 people attended the premiere where they were first screened. The impact has not just been short-term and there has been sustained engagement with the project by stakeholders in the town and wider region: the local school integrated digital storytelling into its curriculum; the approach has been adopted by two nearby towns; and the project has influenced regional government educational policy.

We have taken on board R1â€™s suggestion to better describe how CrowdMemo (CM) builds on existing action research, in particular the work of Hayes, Crabtree and Chamberlain. In order to make space to reference this work, we have removed figures 3 and 4. \  \ We have clarified the research contribution in 3 ways: \  \ a. By better showing how our work extends Taylor et al.â€™s Best Paper from CHIâ€™13, which identified the research challenges involved in sustaining community engagement with technology prototypes. We have restructured the introduction to expand on our description of Taylor et al.â€™s research along with other studies that have addressed the problem of sustained engagement in community ICT interventions. We have restructured the discussion where we now propose a set of five recommendations for facilitating sustained community engagement and extend Taylor et al.â€™s findings. \  \ b. We have clarified that â€œthis paper is much more than simply a case studyâ€ù (R4) by better explaining that it analyses an ICT intervention to investigate an important HCI research issue, namely, how to bring about sustained community engagement. We have highlighted that a significant contribution is how our project facilitated appropriation and we have provided more details on how the Ministry of Education evaluated CM.  \  \ c. We have restructured the paper. In the abstract we have signposted the research question, clarified our method and summarised the contribution. Following R1â€™s suggestions, we have rewritten the discussion in order to remove all new findings and include the five main recommendations for sustainable ICT interventions, along with the discussion of limitations (R4). We have discussed each recommendation and signposted how it builds on related literature. We have written a new conclusion section that shows how our recommendations answer the research question signposted in the abstract and introduction. \  \ Following R2's recommendation, we have signposted the quotes showing the importance of the intergenerational engagement for the participants. \  \ In response to R1â€™s concerns, we have provided more method information (e.g. 22 interviews were carried out). Following R6â€™s recommendation, we have provided more information about our action research approach and explained that we have conducted one action research cycle and that this paper is part of the reflection stage. Furthermore, we have described what some participants considered to be a limitation of the project, namely, the â€œshort duration of the training phaseâ€ù. \  \ Finally, we have corrected all typos, a paragraph repetition and two missing references highlighted by R2. \ ",hci4d,Mara Balestrini,Jon Bird,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:09,pn1982,A,Towards Accurate and Practical Predictive Models of Active-Vision-Based Visual Search,David,Kieras,kieras@umich.edu,pn1982-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"David Kieras, Anthony Hornof","kieras@umich.edu, hornof@cs.uoregon.edu",1223,David,,Kieras,kieras@umich.edu,EECS Department,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,Michigan,United States,,,,,,3622,Anthony,,Hornof,hornof@cs.uoregon.edu,Dept. of Computer Science and Information Science,University of Oregon,Eugene,Oregon,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Being able to predict the performance of interface designs using models of human cognition and performance is a long-standing goal of HCI research.

We eliminated the duplicated paragraph pointed out by the reviewers. \  \ P. 2. We shortened the discussion of Williams's estimate of reaction times. \  \ P. 5. We tightened up the description of the availability functions in the model. \  \ References - we eliminated a few redundant ones and added additional ones, including the previous presentation of a subset of the modeling results pointed out by one of the reviewers, and an additional real-world reference. \  \ In several other places, we've tightened up the discussion, taking into account some of the other remarks by the reviewers as well as the specific issues called out by the meta-review. \  \ Below are how we addressed the meta-review issues, re-ordered to group related items together, our original rebuttal material is included, followed by a final version changes. \ ------- \  \  2) Assumptions about the priority scheme (see R1). \  \ The paper could mention earlier attempts to fit more complex models in which production rules try to match each possible combination of properties to pick the object with the largest number of sought-for properties. However, because the color is usually the critical property involved in the choice of next fixation, including these other match combinations did not have much effect. So the priority scheme just makes the model simpler to implement while having very little effect on the choice of next object to fixate. However, the similarity between the priority scheme and the acuity functions is a point of confusion that could be alleviated. Thanks for pointing this out! \ ------- \ The ""Task Strategy"" section on P. 6 was revised to include this explanation for how the priority scheme reflects the acuity functions. \ ------- \  4) What was exactly the parameter fitting process (R2)? \  \ We can explain that this was a manually conducted iterative search in which the acuity function parameters and the retention time were adjusted to maximize the goodness of fit to the data.The quadratic shape and relative spread of the acuity functions for different properties are based on results in the literature in visual perception - for example, color is more visible than shape with greater eccentricity, and larger objects can be recognized better than smaller in the periphery. These differences in availability are strong at larger eccentricities, as primarily determined by the quadratic coefficient. So the other parameters of the acuity functions were kept constant to simplify the search.  \ ------- \ Brief explanations were inserted where needed, starting on P. 5 with the introductory paragraph under THE EPIC MODEL, and in the explanation of fitting the parameters of the acuity functions and persistence parameter. \ ------- \  5) What is the stopping criterion (Yes/No)? (R2) \  \ The flowchart shows two interacting parallel threads of processing. The decision to continue is No if the other thread has shut down the processing by finding a match; otherwise this thread runs at the same time. We will consider a better label for this box - such as ""Still Searching?"" and clarify the two parallel thread representation. \ ------- \ We revised Fig. 8 and P. 6 to be more clear about about the parallel threads and the stopping criterion in the task strategy. \ ------- \ ------- \ We added a section on P. 7 subheaded ""Generality of the strategy and obtained parameter values"" which addresses the following issues: \ ------- \ 1) The persistence parameter was set to 9 seconds. How can this parameter \  be determined for other tasks and contexts? (R1) \  \ The value of this parameter should apply to similar displays and tasks; a shorter persistence is suggested by other work cited for very sparse displays. There are interesting contingent-display eye tracking studies of natural scenes that yield retention times similar to this value. So how it might differ for other display/task combinations requires additional experiments and modeling. We can add a recommendation that the parameter value should be applied only to similar displays and tasks. \ ------- \ We also clarified the determination of this parameter value (P. 4). \ ------- \  3) Attribution of results to acuity functions, persistence time, and task \  strategy (see R1). \  \ If any of these three are substantially different, the model fails to fit some aspect of the data. The paper could briefly summarize what each of these contributes. \ ------- \ This is summarized in the new section. \ ------- \  6) Can you describe real-world tasks where the model can be applied to? \  (R2) \  \ We could mention that tasks with many color- and shape-coded icons are common in military HCI settings such as modern computer-driven displays of radar data, and can try to insert some additional citations where readers can see what these are like.  \   \ ------- \ Our revised introduction (P. 1) highlights the real-world issues using the iPhone icon example better, and the new P. 7 section refers to military radar displays. \ ------- \  7) Does the model generalize? (R3) This question is related to some of \  the previous questions. \  \ We can be explicit that the model strategy and processing should generalize to visual search tasks in which the visual field lacks overall structure to guide the search and the target object has to be located based on its visual features.  \  \ ------- \ The P. 7 section is explicit about the scope of the model strategy and parameter values. \ ------- \  8) Are the statistics robust? Can you add error bars and what will they \  show us? (R3) \  \ Williams conducted a truly heroic study for his time, but because he did not report his data fully, trying to add confidence intervals would be ""guestimating"" only; we felt it was better to simply state the problem and assert the high reliability of the data (due to the reported very large sample sizes). For example, based on the data reported in his paper, for the proportion (0.6) of fixations on the matching color in the Color-only cue condition, the guestimated 95% binomial confidence interval ranges from 0.591 to 0.609. Such error bars are too small to visible on the graphs. We could attempt to convey something of this to justify why they aren't shown. \  \ With regard to the reliability of the model predictions, we should say that trial runs were done to determine the Monte-Carlo run size required for stable predictions. EPIC models that predict mean performance are typically not set to randomly sample component parameters about their mean values, but rather restrict the random variation to sources that are unavoidable in the task (e.g. where the target object happens to be located) or that are theoretically critical such as the perceptual noise in the acuity function. Thus the predictions are stable at relatively small run sizes; error bars around them would be so small as to be redundant.  \ ------- \ Because of the space limitations, we couldn't say as much as we provided in the rebuttal. On P. 3 we've tried to provide a very brief explanation of why the Williams data is reliable, namely that each proportion is based on thousands of fixations.  On P. 6 we've indicated that the number of Monte-Carlo trials was adequate to produce stable predictions. \ ",,David Kieras,Anthony Hornof,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 16:38,pn1983,A,MisTable: Reach-through Personal Screens for Tabletops,Diego,Martinez Plasencia,diego.martinez-plasencia@bristol.ac.uk,pn1983-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Diego Martinez Plasencia, Edward Joyce, Sriram Subramanian","diego.martinez-plasencia@bristol.ac.uk, ej0502@my.bristol.ac.uk, sriramable@gmail.com",28400,Diego,,Martinez Plasencia,diego.martinez-plasencia@bristol.ac.uk,Department of Computer Science,University of Bristol,Bristol,Avon,United Kingdom,,,,,,38539,Edward,,Joyce,ej0502@my.bristol.ac.uk,Bristol Interaction and Graphics Group,Bristol,Bristol,Avon,United Kingdom,,,,,,2491,Sriram,,Subramanian,sriramable@gmail.com,,University of Bristol,Bristol,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We present MisTable, a tabletop system that combines a conventional horizontal interactive surface with personal screens between the user and the tabletop surface. These personal screens, built using fog, are both see-through and reach-through. Being see-through provides direct line of sight of the personal screen and the elements behind it on the tabletop. Being reach-through allows the user to switch from interacting with the personal screen to reaching through it to interact with the tabletop or the space above it. The personal screen allows a range of customisations and novel interactions such as presenting 2D personal contents on the screen, 3D contents above the tabletop or augmenting and relighting tangible objects differently for each user. Besides, having a personal screen for each user allows us to customize the view of each of them according to their identity or preferences. Finally, the personal screens preserve all well-established tabletop interaction techniques like touch and tangible interactions. We explore the challenges in building such a reach-through system through a proof-of-concept implementation and discuss the possibilities afforded by the system.

Butz et al. was added to previous approaches using HMDs. Previous work from Rakkalolainen was cited (last part of the section), putting extra effort in pointing out how our exploration of interaction opportunities goes far beyond those suggested in his work. The work by DiVerdi et al. (stereo techniques for fog screen)is cited later in Depth Perception of 3D contents \  \ Fog Screen for tabletops: \ We modified the introductory paragraphs of this section to highlight the artefacts related to projection on FogScreens that Rakkalolainen identified, and highlighting the issues that are specially relevant for our system, given its features (short projection-observer distance, frecuency of arms reaching through). \  \ Discussion: \ We removed old paragraphs number four and six and added discussion on the issues raised by the reviewers, such as ergonomy related to touchless and 3D interaction, and influence of fog and visual clutter on social interaction around MisTable.  \  \ We finally corrected some typos here and there and fixed missing figure numbers. We also clarified some small issues raised by reviewers (why Fig. 3b users a log scale, why using 4DOF head tracking). We added details to figures 4 and 5 to make them more clear.

On the other hand, quantitative captures of physiological data are effective; providing detailed, unbiased and continuous responses of players, but lack contexts for interpretation. This paper documents how both approaches could be used together in practice by comparing video-cued retrospective think-aloud data and physiological data collected during a video gameplay experiment. We observed that many interesting physiological responses did not feature in participants' think-aloud data, and conversely, reports of interesting experiences were sometimes not observed in the collected physiological data. Through learnings from our experiment, we present some of the challenges when combining these approaches and offer some guidelines as to how qualitative and quantitative data can be used together  to gain deeper insights into player experiences.",Paper,Chek Tien Tan,chektien.tan@uts.edu.au,"1.

A crucial challenge for these users is aiming the camera properly to take a well-framed picture of the desired target object. We investigate the effects of two fundamental constraints of object recognition â€“ frame rate and camera field of view â€“ on a blind personâ€™s ability to use an object recognition smartphone app. The app was used by 18 blind participants to find visual targets beyond armâ€™s reach and approach them to within 30 cm. While we expected that a faster frame rate or wider camera field of view should always improve search performance, our experimental results show that in many cases increasing the field of view does not help, and may even hurt, performance. These results have important implications for the design of object recognition systems for blind users.",Paper,James M Coughlan,coughlan@ski.org,"1.

We have edited the paper to make it clear that our results are limited to smartphone guidance for blind users, and have limited generalizability. The main edits supporting this change are in an entirely new paragraph immediately preceding the â€œParticipantsâ€ù section and a new sentence in the Conclusion. \  \ 2.) Motivating the experimental design and scenarios at a higher level: Some edits for this are in the new paragraph immediately preceding the â€œParticipantsâ€ù section, while other edits are in the revised â€œDerived Scenariosâ€ù section. \  \ 3.) Clarifications of statistical analysis and results: We have re-organized the description of the experimental scenarios, so that the actual scenario used in the experimental trials is now called Scenario 0, to distinguish it clearly from the four derived scenarios (used in ex post facto analysis), Scenarios 1 through 4. The Tables and Figures have been updated to reflect this new organization. The edits in the â€œDerived Scenariosâ€ù section explaining the motivation for the derived scenarios, as well as the improvements to the Tables and Figures (see below), make the analysis and results easier to understand. Specifically, we have clarified that the ANOVAs were run on the median of the time-to-target data and also on the median of the out-of-FOV data, and we have also clarified why the time-to-target data was analyzed in the log domain. \  \ 4.) Editorial issues: \ (a) We have clarified the motivation for the derived scenarios in the â€œDerived Scenariosâ€ù section. \ (b) The definition of C(FOV) is clarified in the â€œProcedureâ€ù section. \ (c) The introduction of Scenario 0, and the improved motivation for the derived scenarios, has resulted in a re-organization of the results section that is now easier to understand. \ (d) Legibility and layout of Figs. 3, 4, 5: The figures have been edited for improved legibility and layout. \ (e) Minor issues have been addressed, including: the word â€œhighlightedâ€ù was changed to â€œreinforcedâ€ù in the first sentence of the Discussion; we added an observation that â€œmany participants seemed to approach the experiment as a game that was mostly enjoyableâ€ù in the â€œQualitative Observationsâ€ù section; and we eliminated contractions throughout paper (e.g., â€œdoesnâ€™tâ€ù was changed to â€œdo notâ€ù), except in direct quotations of participants. \ ",IxSc,Roberto Manduchi,James Coughlan,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 14:25,pn2003,A,Establishing Design Guidelines in Interactive Exercise Gaming: Preliminary Data from Two Posing Studies,Monica,Zaczynski,monica.zaczynski@carleton.ca,pn2003-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Monica Zaczynski, Anthony Whitehead","monica.zaczynski@carleton.ca, anthony_whitehead@carleton.ca",38551,Monica,,Zaczynski,monica.zaczynski@carleton.ca,Human-Computer Interaction,Carleton University,Ottawa,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,15126,Anthony,,Whitehead,anthony_whitehead@carleton.ca,Human Computer Interaction,Carleton University,Ottawa,Ontario,Canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Interactive gaming has demonstrated promise as a low-cost, at-home training and fitness instruction alternative. Gaming systems offer convenience and the ability to provide enhanced reporting and progress data if body measurement information is collected effectively. However, commercially available systems today are designed primarily for entertainment and as a result, the quality of instruction delivery and level of involvement may not meet the needs of a user performing a disciplined activity. \  \ This paper will look at adapting for occlusion and lack of visibility; learning and orientation; and providing feedback in an effort to determine if there is an ideal visual demonstration delivery that maximizes pose understanding and user self-efficacy, determine whether supplementary modalities are important for instruction, and determine if there is an ideal feedback delivery that promotes pose comprehension, confidence and motivation.  This information can provide a guideline for designing clear and supportive, interactive training systems that can engage users, prevent injury and help maintain fitness. \ ",Paper,Monica Zaczynski,Monica_zaczynski@hotmail.com,"1.

The problem is widespread; 30% of our 294 participants had an email or social networking account accessed by an unauthorized party. Five themes emerged from our results: (1) compromised accounts are often valuable to victims, (2) attackers are mostly unknown, but sometimes known, to victims, (3) users acknowledge some responsibility for keeping their accounts secure, (4) usersâ€™ understanding of important security measures is incomplete, and (5) harm from account hijacking is concrete and emotional.

We then describe a program of ethnographic work with artists who feature found and broken technologies as central methods and topics of work. Finally, we describe an installation and self-study project of our own, â€œScale,â€ù that extends these lines of analysis through collaborative acts of building with broken and discarded technologies. We argue that such integrated programs of work offer one useful model for leveraging the theoretical, ethnographic and material dimensions of HCI work; and that the distinct â€œpropensitiesâ€ù of found and broken objects can challenge and extend HCI notions of creativity and design itself.",Paper,Steven Jackson,sjj54@cornell.edu,"1.

The idea has illustrated a new approach using digital game design for children health care purpose ,"1. Provide more detail about the game and how the user interact with it on the â€œDoDo Game designâ€ù section \ â€œIn the start of each sub-game, the blinking sample object (e.g., a butterfly) appears in a talk bubble next to the DoDo character with the â€œPick Thisâ€ù text and audio. Then four groups of objects appear on the screen for the kid to pick the most similar one. Based on his/her color vision the kid will pick either normal visionâ€™s choice objects or color-blindâ€™s choice objects or neutral objects. Figure 2 shows sub-game 3 with butterfly characters and Table 1 shows the four object groups for sub-game 3. \ The gameâ€™s win-lose condition is independent on whether the participants have color deficiencies. The player would be prompted to play the game again if his/her choices are the content neutral objects as this reveals the player does not fully understand the rules of the game or is being uncooperative. Otherwise, the player always wins the game. In the end of the game the screen always displays the message â€œYou Win!â€ù This is designed intentionally to not discourage color deficient children. Parents or clinicians can click on the information icon located on the top right of the screen to access the color deficiency test result.â€ù \ 2. Describe of the two gold standard tests and provide a very short explanation of the appearance/operation of each ( page 3)  \ â€œIn the Ishihara test, participants are required to recognize and read numbers from plate 1 to 17 presented within the test book (Ishihara 24 plates Edition, year 1998). Each plate contains circle dots of different colors forming a target number that would be invisible to a person with color deficiency but visible to a normal vision person, or the other way around. In Farnsworth D15 Panel test, participants were asked to arrange sixteen color caps in correct order in a rainbow order.â€ù \  \ 3. Add on comparison data to Table 3 and provide further explanation on the paragraph above (page 3 and 4) \ â€œIshihara testâ€™s protan/deutan classification plates are more effective for Deutans than for Protans while D15 classification is considered to be more reliable than Ishihara test [6] therefore we focused on the comparison between the results of D15 and DoDo game. Four subjects #19, #20, #24, #26 were detected as normal/slight deficiencies in both the D15 and DoDo game. These subjects were unable to classify on sub-game 4 designed to classify protanopia and deuteranopia. Both tests also cannot classify subject #15. DoDo game and D15 have the same result for seven Deutan and one Protan subjects. The only difference is subject #21 who is classified as a Protan by DoDo game but as a Deutan by D15 (Table 3).â€ù \ 4. Mention the rationale and the implication of User study at page 3  \ â€œâ€_Although DoDo game was designed for young children aged two and a half to six years old, current clinical practice does not ask children at that age to do colorblind tests at hospitals, therefore, no color-blind participants younger than 6 would be available for recruitment. This user study recruited 6-17 years old participants so that gold standard Ishihara and D15 tests can be used to evaluate the gameâ€™s reliability. The implication of using this older participant group is that we canâ€™t claim the generalizability of the originally intended target group. However, the study validated that DoDo game produced comparable results with gold standard testsâ€ù \ 5. Remove IMI test ( on enjoyment)  to remain 4 pages length  \ 6.

By understanding computed, structural relationships between entities of different types (e.g., people and locations), users can leverage domain expertise and intuition to determine the importance and relevance of these relationships for tasks, such as intelligence analysis. Biclusters are a potentially desirable method to facilitate this, because they reveal coordinated relationships that can represent meaningful relationships. Bixplorer, a visual analytics prototype, supports interactive exploration of textual datasets in a spatial workspace with biclusters. In this paper, we present results of a study that analyzes how users interact with biclusters to solve an intelligence analysis problem using Bixplorer. We found that biclusters played four principal roles in the analytical process: an effective starting point for analysis, a revealer of two levels of connections, an indicator of potentially important entities, and a useful label for clusters of organized information.",Note,Maoyuan Sun,smaoyuan@vt.edu,"1.

The time stamps indicates that for most users this happened in the beginning of their analysis. We also add a discussion that we did not give users instructions on any particular analytical approach, so the differences of the timestamp resulted from the preference of users on where to start their analysis. Besides, we switch the position of the second and the third column in Table 1, which follows the time sequence that how many documents were opened in the workspace before users opened their first bicluster, and when users opened their first bicluster.  \  \ 3) Based on R2â€™s concern that we did not discuss user performance in this study, we add a new column in Table 1, which shows the number of attack identified by users in this study, and discuss user performance in the first paragraph of Result section.  \  \ 4) To clarify the confusion about the rate of non-uniform biclusters (72%) raised by R3, we add a discussion that the rate of non-uniform biclusters (72%) is not a parameter that we manually set in Bixplorer. For the Crescent dataset, the number of non-uniform biclusters found by Bixplorer happens to be 72% of the total number of biclusters found. This rate in 10 usersâ€™ workspace is higher than 72%, which indicates that users preferred non-uniform over uniform biclusters in their analysis. \  \ 5) Based on R4â€™s concern that our last two claims (claim 3 & 4) relied on anecdotal data, we clarify the quantitative data mentioned above to support our claim 3, and add new quantitative data (7 of 13 usersâ€™ final workspaces had spatial layouts similar to that shown in Figure 3, and 6 of these 7 users mentioned that biclusters provided the labeling capability to assist their analysis) to support our claim 4. \  \ 6) Based on R2â€™s suggestion about improving readability of figures, we fix all three figures in our paper by changing background color to white and increasing text size. \  \ 7) Considering R2â€™s question what the difference is between this paper and our previous paper about Bixplorer, we add a brief discussion about the preliminary results of the user study in our previous Bixplorer paper to help address the difference between this paper and our previous paper. \  \ 8) Based on our AC's suggestion, we have made all suggested changes to improve the readability of our paper. \ ",,Maoyuan Sun,Chris North,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 17:17,pn2029,A,Printing Teddy Bears: A Technique for 3D Printing of Soft Interactive Objects,Scott,Hudson,scott.hudson@cs.cmu.edu,pn2029-paper.pdf,10,letter,"Times_New_Roman Arial,Bold Times_New_Roman,Bold Times_New_Roman,Italic Arial Arial,Italic",,Scott Hudson,scott.hudson@cs.cmu.edu,1007,Scott,,Hudson,scott.hudson@cs.cmu.edu,HCI Institute,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,Disney Research Pittsburgh,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper considers the design, construction, and example use of a new type of 3D printer which fabricates three-dimensional objects from soft fibers (wool and wool blend yarn).

This material is a form of loose felt formed when fibers from an incoming feed of yarn are entangled with the fibers in layers below it.  The resulting objects recreate the geometric forms specified in the solid models which specify them, but are soft and flexible â€“ somewhat reminiscent in character to hand knitted materials.  This extends 3D printing from typically hard and precise forms into a new set of forms which embody a different aesthetic of soft and imprecise objects, and provides a new capability for researchers to explore the use of this class of materials in interactive devices.

Reading outcome is heavily dependent on the level of engagement while reading. In this paper, we present FOCUS, an EEG-augmented reading system which monitors a childâ€™s engagement level in real time, and provides contextual BCI training sessions to improve a childâ€™s reading engagement. A laboratory experiment was conducted to assess the validity of the system. Results showed that FOCUS could significantly improve engagement in terms of both EEG-based measurement and teachersâ€™ subjective measure on the reading outcome.

However, this notion of replayability is both overly broad and incomplete as a motivation.

We argue that bridging concepts address the challenge of facilitating exchange between theory and practice in HCI, and we compare it to other intermediary forms of knowledge such as strong concepts and conceptual constructs. We propose that bridging concepts have three defining constituents: a theoretical foundation, a set of design articulations and a range of exemplars that demonstrate the scope and potential of their application. These constituents specify how bridging concepts, as a form of knowledge, are accountable to both theory and practice.

As a consequence, we have also changed the title of the paper. Peepholes now serve an auxilliary role in the paper as an extended example of bridging concepts.  \  \ - We have articulated how bridging concepts are different from strong concepts.  As part of the revision, the sections introducing and positioning the notion of bridging concepts have been extended. This has also given room to better outline how it is related to other concepts. We have dedicated the most space to positioning it in relation to strong concepts and conceptual constructs, but also brought in other intermediary level concepts, e.g. Koskinenâ€™s labs, Zimmermanâ€™s framing constructs, Bowersâ€™ annotated portfolios, and Alexanderâ€™s patterns. \   \ - We have added a section with two further examples of concepts we consider to embody the characteristics of bridging concepts, namely affordances and perceptual crossing from the work of Deckers. We have also added sections in the discussion about how other concepts, e.g. touchpoints from service design, may be developed to function as bridging concepts. \  \ We have furthermore incorporated the final comments from the shepherd: \  \ - The section on conceptual constructs has been expanded. \ - The differences between conceptual constructs and strong concepts have been clarified, the notion of bridging concepts has been positioned more strongly in relation to these concepts, and the relevance of bridging concepts made clear. \ - Minor issues, e.g. in relation to the notion of Labs, have been addressed. \ - Further information has been added to the sections on related work to better account for the origin and intent of the contributions mentioned. \ - The analysis of peepholes has been shortened. \ ",,Peter Dalsgaard,Christian Dindler,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 17:26,pn2054,A,Exploring Affective Communication Through Variable-Friction Surface Haptics,Joseph,Mullenbach,jmullenbach@gmail.com,pn2054-paper.pdf,10,letter,Times-Roman,,"Joseph Mullenbach, Craig Shultz, J.

Our findings reveal that patientsâ€™ understanding of diabetes, their choice of treatments, their routine management, and their interactions with others (in the physical world) and among themselves (in the online world) are influenced by many factors: belief in traditional Chinese versus western medicine, cultural and social norms regarding social eating and drinking, conflicts over self-images, and responses to comments and pressures of coworkers.

We accordingly made the following changes.  \  \ 1. We added methods details into the paper, as explained in our rebuttal.  \  \ 2. We rewrote certain paragraph (p1, last paragraph) and revised a number of sentences throughout that previously read over-claiming (e.g. using â€œpatients in our studyâ€ù to replace â€œpatientsâ€ù in general), and we also added two explicit sentences to acknowledge the *limitation* of this study in Conclusion. We made it clear that our study only investigated Sweet Home patients, providing some insights into the diabetes management in the specific social and cultural context, and we do not claim to understand the entire populations.  \  \ 3. We added a few sentences throughout, and one specific paragraph, the last paragraph in Conclusion to highlight our contributions to HCI. \    \ 4. We removed the explicit interpretation of Structuration Theory within the paper (page 7). However, our discussion on observed diabetic practices (as well as other similar studies) is indeed influenced by understanding the focus of this theory, i.e., the mutual constitution and impact of social context and (individual) human actions; therefore we keep this specific reference only in the end, to acknowledge the intellectual influence. (Note, we tried first to include how we used the Theory specifically. However, due to the page limit, we had to cut significant amount of empirical materials. Considering the nature of conference paper, we decided to keep our rich empirical findings for this paper. We would like to add more discussion on our theoretical contributions in our future journal article from this study. Regardless, we are willing to make changes if 1AC thinks itâ€™s necessary to provide further clarification at certain places.) \  \ 5. We made English annotations to the Figure on p3, adding translations to the main structure of webpage and content of the example post, as one of the reviewer asked. \  \ 6. We also made some writing changes in Literature review; and in design implications to make the information flow more smoothly. We also highlighted the importance of publication health awareness in Chinese society. \  \  \ ",,Xiaomu Zhou,Si Sun,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:35,pn2084,A,The influence of controllers on immersion in mobile games,Paul,Cairns,paul.cairns@york.ac.uk,pn2084-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Paul Cairns, Jing Li, Wendy Wang, A.

This paper shows, with two experiments, that based on an existing typology, more naturalness does not make games more immersive. \ ","The summary update of the review process was that we should make the changes as proposed in the rebuttal and also address R3â€™s criticism more deeply. We report here the revisions we have made accordingly. \  \ R3 had concerns in relation to naturalness which was also raised in the rebuttal and they also raised the issue of direct manipulation being more relevant. \  \ We altered the emphasis of the introduction, particularly the last two paragraphs to emphasise the use of Skalski et al.â€™s notion of naturalness as the focus of the work done. This change is reflected in the abstract. In the section Controllers and Gaming Experience, Skalski et al. is discussed and we have added a list of the four levels of naturalness that are identified there and emphasised this focus in the last paragraph of that section. The experimental aims are more clearly couched in terms of the naturalness framework and the mapping to each type of naturalness made explicit in the discussion of the games in each experimental method. \  \ R3 suggested we consider direct manipulation as relevant in interpreting the results of experiment 2 rather than naturalness. We hope the clarifications made on naturalness would now make it clear what we meant by naturalness and why we interpreted things that way. Also, all games more or less have direct manipulation as understood in Shneidermanâ€™s original formulation (with the exception of reversibility of actions usually) and there is no distinction to be made between the interaction styles in this formulation. However, instrumental interaction does have similarities with the concerns we raise and so we have added a paragraph to discuss those though it raises more issues than it solves. \  \ The issue (R1) of using other scales like the GEQ was addressed by introducing a new second paragraph of the second section,  noting that the popular GEQ and PENS scales are not publically available and in the GEQâ€™s case, not validated. This supplements the discussion of our choice to focus on immersion that was already in the paper. \  \ We have made it clear that we chose casual games as they suit an experimental approach but in the final conclusions we note that this is a limitation of this work that ought to be addressed through further work.  The varitions in experimental set up between experiments, specifically use of incentives and the playing durations, are justified in the participants and procedure sections of the second experiment, respectively. \  \ In both experiments when describing the games used, we have better explained the control styles including a figure in experiment 2 and discussed how in both experiments the controls reflect very common styles of (at least casual) mobile game controls.  \  \ We have included a reference to the work indicated by R2 towards the end of the literature review to show that the space of controls on mobile games is being actively explored. Though as noted in our rebuttal, this work is not directly related to the concerns of this paper. \  \ The reviewers asked why we did not conduct more qualitative analysis. We have added  in the literature review that in McGloin et al.â€™s study, though the manipulation of naturalness influenced experience, players did not perceive the different in naturalness as measured through a 13-item scale. We also note in the discussion of experiment 2 that qualitative questions about why tilt and slip were different were not asked because this was neither possible nor anticipated. \  \ We have also worked to remove all typos. \ ","games, IxSc",Paul Cairns,A.

In addressing this \    concern, the text messages were designed to contain words \    within different surrounding contexts.

How effective are they? We conducted an online experiment (N = 220) to find out. Our data show that both these strategies raise red flags for usersâ€”appeals to instant gratification make users more leery of the site and warnings make them perceive greater threat to personal data.

We used a mixed-method approach, combining the quantitative analysis of 9495 online enterprise communities and interviews with community members. Our results show that too little or too much overlap in topic with other communities causes a communityâ€™s activity to suffer.

All your questions and concerns are clarified below: \  \  \ â€¢	acknowledging the challenges of interfaces dynamics \  \ A section called â€œinterface dynamicsâ€ù was added to the end of the implementation section. \ While WADE demonstrates a promising step towards addressing the power and ease of use trade-off for runtime modifications, it is important to note that WADE is not without its limitations. The WYSIWYG modification of the GUI hierarchy in WADE only applies to the initialization state of the application. Interfaces, on the other hand, are often dynamic, with live code running that may change the interface from how it appeared at the moment it was imported into WADE. These changes to the application may conflict with the modifications implemented in WADE, leading to unstable modifications that do not behave as expected. Developers are advised to first get familiar with application behavior and identify potential runtime interface dynamics before using WADE for performing runtime modifications. \  \ â€¢	being more clear about current implementation \  \ The implementation of the modifications in the scenarios is discussed in the â€œDiscussionâ€ù section on page 4. More details can be found in the section â€œIntegrating WADE with the IDE and GUI builderâ€ù. Using the algorithm mentioned in this section, WADE can apply the changes made by a third-party programmer to the cloned GUI hierarchy, to the host application. All these modifications in the scenarios can be actually authored by â€œAdding widgetsâ€ù, â€œDeleting widgetsâ€ù, â€œProperty modificationâ€ù and â€œEvent handler modificationsâ€ù. To make it clearer for readers, we add some explanations to the â€œDiscussionâ€ù section on page 4. â€œThe only code she needs to write is the code specifically related to her functionality, which will modify the cloned GUI hierarchy and further apply these changes into the original application. The detailed implementation is discussed in the following sections.â€ù \ â€¢	discussing the ceiling or limitations of GUI builder metaphor \  \ To discuss the limitations of GUI builder metaphor, we add a subsection â€œLimits of the GUI builder metaphorâ€ù as follows: \ â€œWhile many of the modifications were easier to perform using a GUI builder, participants also found it less convenient when dealing with repetitive or looping tasks. For example, if a participant is asked to change 6 out of 7 labels to a different font type, it is easier to use a loop than perform the change manually multiple times. In such cases, command language is preferred as it allows easy programming of similar and repetitive tasks. This finding is consistent with the previous literature [8]. \ GUI metaphor delivers important benefits to learnability, memorability, and error prevention, but it can be inefficient for frequent users, particularly if the interface is not well designed and presents a long, complex form or a multi-step process [8]. For these cases, a command line interface may be far more efficient, but at the cost of requiring the user to learn command names and syntax, putting more demands on the userâ€™s memory and making more chances for errors.  \ This trade-off can be mitigated by combine the benefits of both approaches. For example, Inky allows sloppy command input and provides rich visual feedback to mitigate the cost on userâ€™s memory and make it less error-prone [8]. Sikuli, on the other hand, include visual images in the command to make it easier and more intuitive to refer to graphical elements [17]). To some extent, WADE follows the same approach by introducing GUI builder into Scottyâ€™s pure command line programming environment to improve the ease of use and robustness of the third party add-on development. However, our user study has revealed that there are room for improvement to best combine the advantages of GUI builder and command line programming to further improve the efficiency of third party add-on development while maintain its ease of use.â€ù \ â€¢	more appropriate positioning and clarity of contribution relative to nearby work \  \ We modify the paper to more appropriate position and clarify our contribution relative to nearby work according to Reviewer 3â€™s comments below. \ 1.	On p2, I think the submission is a bit unfair in its characterization of surface-based versus toolkit-based methods. \  \ In the â€œIntroductionâ€ù section, we cautiously add â€œto some extentâ€ù to say that the limitation of surface-based approach can be overcome by toolkit-based approach. In addition, we add the following text to explain the tradeoff of looking inside the application.â€ù Therefore, there exist a trade-off between generalizability, ease of use, and power (the ability to perform deeper modifications). While the previous approaches all have their advantages, additional solutions are still needed to better balance the power and ease of use for runtime modification of third-party software.â€ù \ 2.	On p4, questioning the robustness of pixel-based text recovery seems irrelevant since you do not actually use the text for anything. \  \ WADE can retrieve the original text label directly from the host applicationâ€™s internal structure and modify the context of text, like the changing label name scenario in the demo video. However, pixel-based approaches like Prefab have to perform one more step that is character recognition process. We would like to change the â€œpotentially unreliableâ€ù to â€œavoidableâ€ù in the â€œComparison with previous approachesâ€ù. It can show the direct and easy way of how WADE works as well as not question the robustness of pixel-based approaches. \ 3.	Whether on p5, or somewhere else, I think this submission probably needs to acknowledge the in-place editor used in Dixon et al's CHI 2012 whole-desktop Bubble Cursor. \  \ The technique used in the whole-desktop bubble cursor is totally based on the Prefab. We may not regard it as more related with WADE beyond Prefab. \  \ 4.	On p9, I do not think it's appropriate to raise the idea of testing new ideas in existing interfaces as an ""Additional Usage Scenario"" that was somehow suggested by a study participant. \  \ We agree with the idea of Reviewer 3 and decide to cut this entire subsection for the sake of other modifications. We also modify the parts that are a little repetitive to save space. \ â€¢	On page 4, paragraph 3, the authors discuss Facades [13].  This work came up in discussion at the PC meeting, and it was noted that Facades *did* permit the change of program behaviors via the widget replacement functionality. This is inconsistent with the way the work is presented right now. \  \ After checking the Facades paper again, we found this mistake and would like to remove this sentence â€œNeither does it support changing or adding program behaviors.â€ù in the section â€œComparison with previous approachesâ€ù. \ ",,Xiaojun Meng,Shengdong Zhao,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:53,pn2103,A,Design Considerations for Parallel Performance Tools,Gavin,Doherty,Gavin.Doherty@cs.tcd.ie,pn2103-paper.pdf,10,letter,Times-Roman,,"Roman Atachiants, David Gregg, Kim Jarvis, Gavin Doherty","atachiar@scss.tcd.ie, David.Gregg@tcd.ie, kjarvis@tcd.ie, Gavin.Doherty@cs.tcd.ie",37194,Roman,,Atachiants,atachiar@scss.tcd.ie,,"Trinity College, The University of Dublin",Dublin,,Ireland,,,,,,38690,David,,Gregg,David.Gregg@tcd.ie,,"Trinity College, The University of Dublin",Dublin,,Ireland,,,,,,41494,Kim,,Jarvis,kjarvis@tcd.ie,,"Trinity College, The University of Dublin",Dublin,,Ireland,,,,,,9186,Gavin,,Doherty,Gavin.Doherty@cs.tcd.ie,,"Trinity College, The University of Dublin",Dublin,,Ireland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In recent years there has been a shift in microprocessor manufacture from building single-core processors towards providing multiple cores on the same chip.

With the aim of identifying issues, emerging practices and design opportunities for support, we present in this paper a qualitative study in which we interviewed a range of software developers, in both industry and academia. We then perform a systematic analysis of the data and identify several cross-cutting themes. These analysis themes include the practical relevance of the probe effect, the significance of orchestration models in development and the mismatch between currently available tools and developers' needs. We also identify an important characteristic of parallel programming, where the process of optimisation goes hand in hand with the process of debugging, as opposed to clearer distinctions which may be made in traditional programming. We conclude with reflection on how the study can inform the design of software tools to support developers in the endeavour of parallel programming. \ ",Paper,Gavin Doherty,Gavin.Doherty@tcd.ie,"1.

This study proposes a systematic approach for exploring a large number of strategies using a computer-cluster-based parallelized modeling system. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the approach for investigating and revealing the effects of different microstrategies on human performance, both within and across individuals, for a time-pressured multimodal dual task. The modeling results suggest that multitasking performance is not simply a matter of interleaving cognitive and sensorimotor processing but is instead heavily influenced by the selection of subtask microstrategies.",Paper,Yunfeng Zhang,zywind@cs.uoregon.edu,"1.

We have reframed the paper to make it more relevant to the general CHI audience by mentioning how the task is similar to many other multitasking settings such as driving and how what we learned from this task could apply to these other multitasking settings.  (p.4, left column, bottom) \  \ 2. We have added references to relevant studies.  We referenced Gray and Boehm-Davis [5] on p.3 right column,  Janssen and Brumby [10] and Kieras and Meyer [12] on p.4 left column. \  \ 3. We explained how the 5 strategy dimensions were chosen on p.4 left column. \  \ 4. We discussed how these strategies could be relevant to other types of multitasking settings on p.4 left column. \  \ 5. We added some discussion about the learning effects in this experiment on p.2 left column. \  \ 6. We took to heart the observation of our strongest advocate, R1, that this work is necessarily complex and made extensive efforts to reduce the complexity of the presentation wherever possible.  We devised names for all of the microstrategies in the paper, and replaced all codes such as Microstrategy 3b with more semantically relevant phrases such as Track-Then-Eyes-To-Sound, and then used these new phrases in places of the codes in the graphs, dramatically reducing the need for readers to flip from page to page to interpret the content of the graphs.

It is unclear how the properties of these devices will affect individualsâ€™ privacy. In this study, we investigate the privacy perspectives of individuals when they are bystanders around AR devices. We conducted 12 field sessions in cafÃ©s and interviewed 31 bystanders regarding their reactions to a co-located AR device. Participants were predominantly split between having indifferent and negative reactions to the device. Participants who expressed that AR devices change the bystander experience attributed this difference to subtleness, ease of recording, and the technologyâ€™s lack of prevalence. Additionally, participants surfaced a variety of factors that make recording more or less acceptable, including what they are doing when the recording is being taken. Participants expressed interest in being asked permission before being recorded and in recording-blocking devices.

The introduction was condensed to better emphasize the generalizability and utility of the model. The Previous Work was re-organized to two sections: Kinesiology and Biomechanics, and Humanâ€“Computer Interaction. The former now shows the related concepts in kinesiology of the thumb functional area and explains why the existing models there cannot be directly applied to thumb input on touchscreens. The latter suggests there exists a need for this model in HCI and among the designers. To address generalizability, we also provide the anthropometric distribution of our sample. We obtained hand size data of Oulasvirta et al, and compared the model outcome in our examples. The generalizability and contributions were also discussed by comparing the model to designer's heuristics. \ ",,Joanna Bergstrom-Lehtovirta,Antti Oulasvirta,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:53,pn2119,A,Modeling the Perception of User Performance,Per Ola,Kristensson,kristensson@gmail.com,pn2119-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Max Nicosia, Antti Oulasvirta, Per Ola Kristensson","ln73@st-andrews.ac.uk, antti.oulasvirta@mpii.de, kristensson@gmail.com",38679,Max,,Nicosia,ln73@st-andrews.ac.uk,School of Computer Science,University of St Andrews,St Andrews,Fife,United Kingdom,,,,,,2881,Antti,,Oulasvirta,antti.oulasvirta@mpii.de,,Max Planck Institute for Informatics,Saarbruecken,,Germany,,,,,,3496,Per Ola,,Kristensson,kristensson@gmail.com,,University of St Andrews,St Andrews,Fife,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper studies how users perceive their own performance in two alternative user interfaces. We extend methodology from psychophysics to the study of interactive performance and conduct two experiments in order to create a model of usersâ€™ perception of their own performance. In our studies, two interfaces are sequentially used in a pointing task, and users are asked to rate in which interface their performance was higher. We first differentiate the effects of objective performance (speed and accuracy) versus interface qualities (distance between elements and width of elements) on perceived performance. We then derive a model that predicts the amount of change required in an interface for users to reliably detect a difference. The model is useful as a heuristic for predicting if a new interface design is better enough for users to reliably appreciate the obtained gain in user performance. We validate the model via a separate user study, and conclude by discussing how to apply our findings to design problems.",Paper,Per Ola Kristensson,kristensson@gmail.com,"1. Accot, J., and Zhai, S.

In the context of a broader study about personal online content, participants were asked to search for themselves using their own computers and the browsers and queries they would normally adopt. Our analysis highlights five motivations for self-search: as a form of identity management; to discover reactions to and reuse of user-generated media; to re-find personal content; as a form of entertainment; and to reveal lost or forgotten content. Strategies vary according to motivation, and may differ markedly from typical information-seeking, with users looking deep into the results and using image search to identify content about themselves.

Nevertheless a repeated but critical challenge in design is translating empirical findings into actionable ideas that inform design, or generating implica-tions for design. Despite various design methods aiming to bridge this gap, knowledge informing design is still seen as problematic. However there has been little empirical explo-ration into what design researchers understand by such design knowledge, the functions and principles behind their creation. We report on interviews with twelve expert HCI design researchers probing the roles and types of design implications, and the process of generating and evaluating them. We synthesize different types of design implications into a framework to guide their generation. Our findings identify a broader range than previously described, addi-tional sources and heuristics supporting their development as well some important evaluation criteria. We discuss the value of these findings for interaction design research. ",Paper,Corina Sas,corina@comp.lancs.ac.uk,"1. Ackerman, M.S.

However, due to the high cost associated with the data collection process, many developing countries conduct such surveys very infrequently and include only a rather small sample of the population, thus failing to accurately capture the current socio-economic status of the country's population. In this paper, we address this problem by means of a methodology that relies on an alternative source of data from which to derive up to date poverty indicators, at a very fine level of spatio-temporal granularity. Taking two developing countries as examples, we show how to analyse the aggregated call detail records of mobile phone subscribers and extract features that are strongly correlated with poverty indexes currently derived from census data.",Paper,Christopher Smith-Clarke,chris.smith@ucl.ac.uk,"1.

We have gathered insights from more than 120 people, with regard to how users experience and make sense of the benchâ€™s shape changing capability. The paper applies McCarthy and Wrightâ€™s six different sense making processes (anticipating, connecting, interpreting, reflecting, appropriating and recounting) as an instrument to analyse peopleâ€™s experience with shape-changing furniture in the wild. The paper also introduces exploring as a seventh sense making process. Based on this analysis, the paper points to three relevant aspects when designing shape-changing artefacts for the wild, namely: 1) Affordance of shape-changing interfaces, 2) Transitions between background and foreground and 3) Interpreting physically dynamic objects.

Also, some formatting issues have been resolved. \ Additionally, a number of changes have been made based on input from the different reviewers and in line with the authorsâ€™ rebuttal. \ This includes: \ We have removed both occurrences of Figure 2 (as numbered in the previous version) â€“ The technical breakdown of the bench and the girl stretched out on the bench. Instead we have added some text to better describe the coMotion bench. We will also submit a video, (as also proposed by the reviewers) on the 26/2. Our intention with the video is that it also can aid in communicating the dynamics and nature of the benchâ€™s movements. \ The purpose of designing the coMotion bench has been stated clearer (for example in the Introduction and The CoMotion Bench sections). \  â€˜The coMotion benchâ€™ section has been reworked, including the subsection â€˜The designâ€™ and â€˜The methodological research approachâ€™. For example the rationale for using a bench, and its design and materials used, has been better described. More information regarding the interviews has also been included. We have specified in more detail who were interviewed, which questions they were asked and we have provided a rationale for this.  \ The contribution of the paper has been made clearer. \ The Discussion (especially the initial part) has been reworked and is now hopefully clearer. \ The Conclusion has been edited to better align with the results presented in the paper. \ The references have been updated.

We logged computer activity and used biosensors to measure stress of 48 students for 7 days for all waking hours, in their in situ environments. We found a significant positive relationship with stress and daily time spent on computers. Stress is positively associated with the amount of multitasking. Conversely, stress is negatively associated with Facebook and social media use. Heavy multitaskers use significantly more social media and report lower positive affect than light multitaskers. Night habits affect multitasking the following day: late-nighters show longer duration of computer use and those ending daily activities earlier multitask less.

","â€œTowards a Closer Dialogue between Policy and Practice: Responsible Design in HCIâ€ù  \ Paper number 2160 \ CHI 2014 \  \ Revision report  \  \ R3 questioned the merit of the paper by arguing that it lacks significant insights. We have clarified our contribution in the abstract, introduction and in our conclusions. We provide a systematic, nuanced comparison of the RRI agenda and HCI research and design (instead of hasty conclusions such as, â€˜RRI needs to be adoptedâ€™ or â€˜the RRI agenda is unrealisticâ€™ etc.). And we make a case for a pragmatic, â€˜unromanticâ€™ and yet engaged reinterpretation of RRI principles for HCI research and design. This way we also respond to R5 who was not sure what to take away from the paper, and what the core novel contribution is. \  \ This clarified line of reasoning and contribution is supported by our discussion of Lynchâ€™s concept of reflexivity. This was a central request of various reviewers: to include a discussion of his approach, and how it relates to RRI and design. This is now a crucial part of the â€œreflexivityâ€ù section and our conclusions.  \  \ We have included a methodology section that explains our case selection strategy, as requested by R2. \  \ We now draw many more, and clearer, conclusions for HCI than for RRI. But we also explain a few points where HCI can critically â€˜talk backâ€™ to RRI. In this regard we discuss the merits of unreflected tacit knowledge, and the concept of the â€˜provocative designerâ€™ (conclusions). \  \ We improved the structure of our paper, as required by R2. We completed the discussion of the perspectives, temporality and scope dimensions for all sections (e.g. in â€œinclusionâ€ù). We also rewrote our conclusions substantially and think that they are much clearer now. \  \ We have made much more explicit throughout the paper (introduction, conclusions, and in the middle) that â€˜responsible designâ€™ is a collaborative effort that requires rethinking and reorganisation of an entire ecosystem of stakeholders (e.g. funders, regulatory agencies) beyond the individual designer, and beyond a projectâ€™s termination (â€œinstitutional reflexivityâ€ù and â€œinstitutional responsibilityâ€ù). This answers R1â€™s concerns.  \  \ As promised in our rebuttal, we have elaborated on how to think of regulating in the wild. â€œAnticipatory governanceâ€ù is now discussed more explicitly in the section on anticipation and in the conclusions. Thereby we have also reacted to R3 (who had criticised that our statement about the poles of acceptance and rejection was banal). We now show more clearly in which sense technology regulation is a matter of user practice, and user agency, from the local to larger-scale community levels. To strengthen our point we referred to the â€˜slow technologyâ€™ movement, and in our conclusions we added a related discussion of â€œenvisioningâ€ù in design (Reeves). R2 had recommended that we include Reeves in our paper, so we think we found an effective way to do so.  \  \ We have included a paragraph on (supposedly) irresponsible design in the introduction, a point raised by R 1. We coupled this with an argument from standpoint theory (Haraway), which strengthens our case for a pragmatic, â€˜unromanticâ€™ and yet engaged understanding of RRI. Thereby we have also responded to R4 (include â€œfeminist standpoint theoryâ€ù, if possible). \  \ As requested by R1, we have clarified our stance on uncertainty. We regard uncertainty as a fundamental feature of reality (see the â€œanticipationâ€ù section and the â€œenvisioningâ€ù discussion in the conclusions) and also as one of the reasons why (ir)responsible design cannot be identified easily (see introduction). \  \ In the â€œreflexivityâ€ù section we have included a discussion of Harper et al. as requested by R1. \  \ We repositioned the â€œgroup reflexivityâ€ù argument (Moncur) â€“ R 3 had argued that we were â€œpicking hairsâ€ù, but we have made it clear now that this is (just) one type of reflexivity among others, and (just) one element within our broader pragmatic interpretation of the concept of reflexivity (conclusions). \  \ The â€œfour pillarsâ€ù repetition (R5) has been removed. \  \ Given the limited text space we had to take the following further decisions: \ - We could include only some of the additional literature suggested by R4 and R2, but we hope that the ones that we did include, and discussed, are now integrated well. Apart from the authors already mentioned we also included Rosner/Bean in the discussion o f (ir)responsible design, and how difficult it is to identify the latter (introduction). \ - In order to â€˜gainâ€™ text space for the necessary changes and amendments we removed some references from the original submission. First, there were those that we did not consider central to our line of reasoning (e.g. Douglas et al.; Stengers/Deutscher). Second, we removed the Knorr Cetina reference and the related paragraph (reflexivity section). R5 had argued that the latter would need further explanation. We agreed and decided that we rather remove the entire original paragraph instead of extending it. We also removed references that were already â€˜coveredâ€™ by others. For instance, Roco et al. is a reference to exemplify the relevance of the RRI discourse beyond Europe, but this argument is also well represented by Randles et al. or Schienke et al.",,Barbara Grimpe,Mark Hartswood,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 18:14,pn2168,A,Pervasive Information through Constant Personal Projection: The Ambient Mobile Pervasive Display (AMP-D),Christian,Winkler,christian.winkler@uni-ulm.de,pn2168-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Christian Winkler, Julian Seifert, David Dobbelstein, Enrico Rukzio","christian.winkler@uni-ulm.de, julian.seifert@uni-ulm.de, david.dobbelstein@uni-ulm.de, enrico.rukzio@uni-ulm.de",17859,Christian,,Winkler,christian.winkler@uni-ulm.de,Institute of Media Informatics,Ulm University,Ulm,,Germany,,,,,,16786,Julian,,Seifert,julian.seifert@uni-ulm.de,,Ulm University,Ulm,,Germany,,,,,,35793,David,,Dobbelstein,david.dobbelstein@uni-ulm.de,Institute of Media Informatics,Ulm University,Ulm,,Germany,,,,,,9778,Enrico,,Rukzio,enrico.rukzio@uni-ulm.de,,Ulm University,Ulm,,Germany,,Lancaster University,Lancaster,,United Kingdom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The vision of pervasive ambient information displays which show relevant information has not yet come true.

We revised the paper as we proposed in the revision planning letter. We carefully considered reviewers' major concerns (particularly about improving its presentation). The following summarizes the revision work done since then.   \  \ 1. Improved introduction section (highlighting the key findings) \ 2. Tightened the related work & methodology sections \ 3. Changed the presentation of the result section  \ 4. Re-wrote the discussion section by summarizing the key findings and discussing their implications, including their relevance/impact in HCI and related fields \ 5. Made a separate analysis section for the regression and classification tests   \ 6. Proofread the manuscript with a native speaker.   \ 7. Created an Appendix section. \  \ Here's revision letter in MS word format:  \ https://www.dropbox.com/s/4fmu0zmq8lzzuro/revision_letter.docx  \  \ In the following, we illustrate more details about each revision work.  \  \  \ 1. Introduction  \ Reviewers commented that the key findings should be clearly delivered; and the result section also needs to be updated accordingly.  In our revision, we tightened the introduction part and re-wrote the summary of the findings as follows:  \   \ Our results uncover several usage patterns that are closely related to smartphone addiction. The risk group spent more time on smartphone use per day (risk group: 253.0 min vs. non-risk group: 207.0 min) than the non-risk group and showed diurnal usage differences (more usage in the morning and evening). For the risk group, usage sessions that were initiated by the push notifications were longer, showing the evidence that notifications acted as external cues for problematic usage. The risk group consumed significantly more online content that can provide instant gratifications (e.g., pastime, entertainment, information seeking). \   \ These findings were corroborated by the results of our analytic modeling and analysis of interview data. Regression analysis shows that the key factors of smartphone addiction such as interference, withdrawal, and tolerance were closely related to usage features. In addition, we use machine learning techniques to experiment with the prediction power of usage features and show that smartphone addiction can be accurately \ classified at the F-score of 0.87. The interview results provided more detailed instances of problematic usage behavior, such as loss of self-control when consuming online content (e.g., aimlessly seeking stimulating content from web/Facebook while in bed). Our key findings support the existing theories about technological addictions [11, 16, 10]. Repeated consumption of stimulating content may lead to addictive \ behaviors, and problematic behaviors are largely dependent on usage function rather than usage amount. \   \  \ 2. Related Work & Methodology Sections \ R1 commented that Related Work & Methodology sections can be tightened; and also some of the less clear sentences need to be fixed.    \  \ * In our revision, we shortened our discussion on Internet-related addiction work and tried to relate the prior work with mobile addiction.   \ * We explicitly stated relevance/difference of this work to the existing work, at the end of each sub-section in the background and related work section.  \ * We re-wrote a list of less-clear or long sentences that R1 commented (e.g., fixing grammar errors, removing â€œand so onâ€ù, explaining what instant rewards means). We updated the description on the work by Amesâ€™ and Harmonâ€™s as R1 suggested.   \ * R1 suggested us to reorganize Background and Related Work / HCI Research on Addictive Behavior: As R1 commented, we listed an example along with each category for easy of understanding.  \   \ The Methodology section was revised as follows:  \ * We tightened a few places with verbose description of data collection and analysis methodologies (as R1 and R3 commented). For instance, some verbose description of SmartLogger app was tightened.  \ * R1 commented that our participants were not entirely in their 20s, and the current description needs to be changed accordingly. We followed R1â€™s suggestion and updated the description as follows: we change â€œyoung population in their 20sâ€ù to â€œcollege students.â€ù  \  \  \ 3. Improving presentation of the result sections  \ We revised the result sections by following the reviewersâ€™ guidelines. As R1/R2 commented, we revised its presentation by tabularizing the relevant and important statistical results. We replaced the figures (displaying raw distributions) with the tables to accommodate the reviewersâ€™ comments.   \  \  * In Table 2, we presented the results about overall usage (i.e., aggregated usage, session-level usage, top-k app usage).  \  \  * Table 3: we presented the results about communication app usage (overall, MIMâ€™s usage amount/frequency, inter-app/notification usage/frequency, etc.)  \  \ Another concern raised by the reviewers was about delivering statistical test results. In the table, we clearly stated the following information: 1) mean value, 2) 95% confidence interval; 2) t-value; 3) exact p-value (two-tailed); 4) effect size (Cohenâ€™s d).    \ As the shepherd suggests, we will submit the supplement material that include some of the missing materials (e.g., raw distribution about usage features).   \  \ R2 has a concern with statistical significance with diurnal analysis. We found that statistical significance can be improved when the number of time segments is small (as Min et al. did [1]). The resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. Figure 5 in the revised version clearly shows that significant differences on usage time were found in the morning and evening time blocks. Overall, each time block has small to medium effect size (Cohenâ€™s d). It is likely that risk group users spend more time over the course of a day.  \  \ [1] Min et al; CSCW 2013, Mining smartphone data to classify life-facets of social relationships, Jun-Ki Min, Jason Wiese, Jason I. Hong, John Zimmerman.  \  \ * We revised â€œOVERALL USAGE PATTERN DIFFERENCESâ€ù section as follows. As R1 commented, we decided not to present â€œrawâ€ù distributions in the figures; accordingly, we removed the description part accordingly. We tried our best to illustrate the key features that we extracted from the dataset; e.g., improved explanation of entropy measure.   \  \ * At the end of each subsection, we have a small section that summarizes the key findings. We originally provided a brief summary of the results in the beginning of each section. But in the revised version, we think that putting together all the findings in a given section is more useful for reasoning about usage behavior relating to smartphone addiction.  \  \  (OVERALL USAGE PATTERN DIFFERENCES) \ Our results showed that the risk group users spent more time on smartphone use than the non-risk group (risk: 253.0 vs. non-risk: 207.0 min). The risk group users tended to use smartphones more frequently and to have longer usage sessions. Their app usage was more skewed to a small number of frequently used apps. In particular, significant differences were found on usage amount/frequency of the first ranked apps. Also, diurnal usage differences were observed, with the risk group spending more time on smartphone use in the morning/evening than the non-risk group. Despite such usage differences, significant differences were not found on the number of unique apps used (risk: 66.1 vs. non-risk: 65.5).  \  \ (Communication App Use) \ For mobile communications, our participants mainly used MIMs: its usage was over 60 minutes and 90% of over 400 notifications per day was from MIMs. While significant differences in overall MIM usage were not found, there were tendencies (the effect size > 0.2) that the risk group uses MIM longer and more frequently than the non-risk group. When dividing smartphone usage into internally/externally cued sessions, we found that 79% of usage was considered as external usage (e.g., MIM, Facebook). We found that the risk groupâ€™s usage time of MIM-initiated sessions was significantly greater than those of the non-risk group. This result confirms that MIM notification act as external cues for smartphone usage and can be considered one cause of problematic smartphone usage. \  \ (Web Browsing App Use) \ Our results showed that compared to the non-risk group, the risk group browsed the web more often, had different diurnal usage patterns, and tended to exhibit the content consumption behavior of seeking more stimulating content (e.g., visiting web portals, checking trending issues). Moreover, a few of the risk group participants excessively consumed possibly stimulating content on the online communities and exhibited unique surfing patterns to seek for stimulating content. \  \  \ 4. Added more discussions on findings, including their relevance/impact in HCI \ As reviewers commented, we worked hard to provide thorough and deep discussion about our findings by emphasizing their relevance and impact in the field of HCI.  \  \ Our exploratory data analysis revealed usage patterns relating to smartphone addiction. We found that the risk group spent more time than the non-risk group on smartphone usage. While the number of used apps was similar, the risk group showed a more skewed usage pattern on a few frequently used apps. In addition, significant diurnal usage differences were found. The risk group used smartphones for longer periods in the morning and evening. Overall, our participants mainly used smartphones for communications. MIM was the most frequently used app, followed by voice calls, SMS, and emails. They received a surprising number of MIM notifications per day (> 400). We found that the risk group spent more time on MIM-triggered sessions. This result serves as evidence that MIM notifications act as external cues for excessive smartphone usage. Another major usage was for consuming various kinds of online content. The risk group users spent more time on the web for consuming such stimulating content. \  \ According to our analysis, the overall difference in usage times between the risk/non-risk groups is not substantially large (< 50 minutes). In addiction literature, however, researchers concurred that excessive and problematic usage of technology is largely dependent on usage function rather than usage amount [11, 16]. For example, repeated usage that is intended for mood adjustment purposes (e.g., relieving boredom, stress, or depression) may form habitual usage (lowering self-control) and lead to addictive behaviors (losing self-control) \ [11, 16, 10]. \  \ Our regression results also confirmed that smartphone addiction is closely related to the content consumption function of smartphones. Our interview results provided a detailed evidence of addictive usage behaviors. The risk group lacked rational self-control, particularly when consuming stimulating content (e.g., aimlessly following web/Facebook links while in the bed). These findings contribute to existing scholarship about addiction scale development and problematic usage behaviors [15, 5, 22]. \  \ Smartphone usage has been studied thoroughly in the literature [8, 4, 21]. Our work supplements existing measurement studies [8, 4, 21] because we are reporting recent smartphone usage patterns (e.g., mobile instant messaging) and dealing with problematic usage behaviors, an emerging social issue associated with technology use. When compared with the usage statistics of the earlier datasets that were collected in 2009 [8] and 2010 [4], we observed significant changes in usage behaviors. We posit that much longer usage (224.7 min vs. 59.2 min [4]) may be due to the participant demographics and the network effect of smartphones and mobile instant messaging. Moreover, our work extends Oulasvirta et al.â€™s work [21] by examining real usage patterns from the perspective of smartphone addiction and showing the importance of externally cued usage behaviors. \  \ Our work contributes new knowledge about usage practices related to mobile communications [17, 3, 12]. We dealt with the latest trends for MIM use. As reported, we found that its usage is prevalent and can be indicative of addiction risks (e.g., causing negative impacts on an individualâ€™s personal and social activities). Thus, our results provide insights into understanding the impact of semi-synchronous communication channels, like MIM, on the social expectations related to constant connectivity [3] and interruption management practices [17]. \  \ Use of computing technology for promotion of health and sustainable behaviors has been of great interest to the HCI community [9]. In addition, addiction-related research has been growing recently [23, 26, 28]. Our results on usage analysis and automatic behavior assessment will be useful when designing mobile software that can moderate excessive use (e.g., visualizing smartphone usage, intervening usage with social support or pressure mechanisms, and gamifying smartphone use regulation) or enable intelligent parental controls (e.g., addressing a childâ€™s smartphone overuse). We believe that designing and evaluating intervention software would be an interesting avenue for future HCI research [7]. Our work can serve as a foundation for such research.  \  \ Similar to any cross-sectional and single-site study, the generalizability of this work may be limited due to the characteristics of our participant sample. However, an earlier measurement study partly affirms the generalizability of this work [8]; i.e., fine-grained usage features such as session time distribution exhibited consistent patterns across the datasets collected from different sites. Future studies should be conducted using different sites, demographics, mobile devices/platforms, and cultural backgrounds in order to explore these topics further and confirm the results. Moreover, the current analysis can be extended by investigating additional contextual factors such as location and transport modes, and other content categories such as social networking and mobile games. \  \  \ 5. Created a separate analysis section for the regression and classification tests   \ In our submission version, classification tests (machine learning) are located in the ""discussion"" section. And regression results are located in the ""problematic usage behavior"" section. As suggested in the rebuttal letter, we put these two parts together as a separate section before the ""problematic usage behavior"" section (i.e., at the end of quantitative analysis and the beginning of qualitative analysis).  As reviewers commented, we clearly stated the key features selected from multiple regression and classification results. Also, we explained that our goal with machine learning is to experiment with the prediction power of the features that we explored. The following is the excerpt from the revised version:  \  \ ANALYTIC MODELING OF USAGE BEHAVIOR \  \ Our results reveal quantitative features on usage between the risk and non-risk group. However, these results do not clarify how the usage features are associated with the self-report addiction level and how well they can predict the potential of smartphone addiction. We thus examined how much each usage feature contributed to the addiction scale through multiple regression analysis. We then demonstrate the prediction power of usage features with machine learning techniques that can automatically classify users into the risk/non-risk groups based on the usage data. \  \ Regression Analysis \  \ The key factors (or symptoms) in the Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale include interferences with work/personal activities (interference), virtual world orientation (virtual), emotional alterations such as anxiety and irritation if smartphone use is impeded (withdrawal), and habituated usage without reducing usage amount (tolerance) [14]. Due to our limited sample size for regression analysis, we chose a set of representative features that could be used to characterize general usage behaviors including overall usage features (usage time/frequency, top-1 app usage time/frequency, top-5 app entropy, and usage time in 6-12/18-24 blocks) and category-specific usage features (MIM usage time/frequency, Web usage time/frequency, MIM/Web usage time in 6-12/18-24 blocks, external MIM session frequency, and aggregated MIM external session length/time). \  \   \ Table 6 summarizes the regression results. Overall, the usage time/frequency were highly related with smartphone addiction. Considering that the usage of instant messaging is dominant, we posited that its usage plays a critical role in problematic usage behaviors. Incoming MIM messages act as external usage cues for smartphone use. Those participants who felt more interference tended to have longer session sequence lengths of MIM initiated sessions. Moreover, web usage and external cues were related to the tolerance factor; consuming stimulating content on the web causes people to continue to use smartphones. \  \ These observations match with the well-known theories of technological addiction [11, 16, 10]. Repeated content consumption (message exchanges, web content) forms habitual usage (lowering self-control) and can eventually lead to addictive behaviors (losing self-control). External cues such as incoming messages, further reinforce a potentially addictive cycle. \  \  \ Classification Analysis \  \ We used machine learning algorithms to automatically classify whether a person belongs to the risk group. For model training, we considered all the features that we explored in the earlier sections. For each feature, we considered the basic statistics: mean, median, SD, and soft min/max (meanÂ±2SD). We used the classification models in Weka v3.6 such as J48 Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM). We reduced the number of features using the Information Gain filter and Rank-based search algorithms. To demonstrate the importance of feature categories, we tested the performance with different category combinations (see Table 7). The general set contained the general usage features such as usage time/frequency, top-k entropies, and sequence length. The temporal set included the diurnal usage features for aggregated usage and category-specific usage. The category set included the category-level usage features (no temporal aspects). The external set included all the usage features for the external sessions. The models were evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. The dataset was divided into 10 roughly equal parts. One part was left out for validation, and the rest were used for training. By repeating this for each part, the average performance of the classifiers were estimated. \  \   \ In Table 7, we report the best accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values. We achieved the best performance when the category set was used with Decision Tree (F-score = 0.87). The ranked features in the best model included web usage time (mean, SD, median), SNS usage time (SD), SNS usage frequency (soft max, median), inter-MIM time (median), inter-browser time (mean, SD, soft max). In contrast, the performance was dropped when all the features were employed; ranked features include four general features, four category features, and two diurnal features. In addition, we examined the prediction power of each feature set. The performance of the general and temporal feature sets did not differ substantially, but the external feature set had the worst performance. To measure performance gain for each feature set, we trained the classifiers by excluding each set. As shown in the table, removing the category feature set resulted in a significant drop in performance, which shows its importance for classification. Moreover, the general features influenced the overall performance negatively. In summary, we found that investigating various category-specific usage patterns was critical, and our classification model allowed us to accurately classify whether a person belonged to the risk group. While the current work is mainly focused on communications and web browsing, our feature selection results indicated the importance of other features. Exploring other categories such as social networking and mobile games is part of our future work \  \  \ 6. Proofreading \ The draft was reviewed by the professional proofreader who fixed many of the grammar and style errors. The readability of the draft thus significantly improved.  \  \ 7. Appendix Section \ As the reviewers and AC suggested, we decided to remove the descriptive figures that were not directly related to illustrating the main findings. In the Appendix section, we put these figures as well as other results that were not included in the paper.   \  \ The following is a brief summary of the Appendix section: We begin with summarizing usage features that were used in this work. We then detail the descriptive statistics various usage features that are important to understand the usage differences and similarities. First, we report the session duration and inter-session duration distributions, and show the diurnal patterns of usage sessions. We illustrate more detailed information about top-ranked apps (i.e., top-1, top-2) and report the distribution of the number of unique apps. Second, we plot diurnal usage patterns of MIM and web browsing. Third, we report detailed information about internal and external sessions (e.g., CI values, p-values). \  \  \ 8.

Much has been said previously regarding sustainability but this has largely focused on environmental rather than interpersonal relations. This paper provides an analysis of how prosocial HCI has been discussed and continues to be defined as a research field. Based on a corpus of published works, we describe a variety of genres of work relating to prosocial HCI. Key intellectual differences are explored, including the epistemological and ethical positions involved in designing for prosocial outcomes as well as how HCI researchers posit economic decision-making.

We propose to add the following to strengthen and extend the observations into the discussion (Broader Lessons for Design) with a more detailed contribution to research on video navigation techniques within HCI: \  \ â€œThe ratio of panning to zooming that we observed empirically in most participants confirms and adds to statements regarding two of our main viewing behaviors. Panning was dominant in both finding better viewing angles and points of interest, and more intuitive as an interaction technique. Zooming was valuable for added detail, but centering on a point of interest was observably more difficult as an interaction, and involved the risk of losing the overview. Still, the frequent use of combined pan-zooms, a fairly complex navigation technique, indicates that both these basic navigation modes for â€œcontent interactionâ€ù [see e.g. 19, 32] on tablet devices are feasible and familiar enough to be used with confidence by participants, without prior training in this particular interface.â€ù \  \ DONE but a bit awkward, this section does not fit entirely into that specific section but I have tried to smooth it over. \  \ In â€œAdvantages of a Second Screenâ€ù in the Discussion, we will strengthen the link to related HCI research: \  \ â€œThese findings relate to a current interest in HCI research in providing tools for participation and content creation at live events [17, 20, 28]. Where this prior work has proposed means creating, sharing and saving content to be viewed afterwards, our work presents an alternative route that provides the visitor with additional content to engage with in the moment. Combining the two approaches, adding a basic broadcasting and recording functionalities would allow visitors to share and save their experiences as memorabilia.â€ù  \  \ DONE \  \ R1 is concerned with how a â€œdirected viewâ€ù is discussed, which may be misleading in the paper. We will clarify that this is in fact a key functionality in the larger system, but not the focus of this particular study. Linking this to our  â€œObservations of Tablet Interactionâ€ù, we propose to add: \ â€œFrom these observations we infer that the initial, more intense interaction is due to familiarizing oneself with the interface, and its novelty value. The following more mixed attention, although likely affected by the trial situation, points to a more realistic range of use patterns. Importantly, the interface supported these different levels of engagement equally well.â€ù  \ DONE \  \ We will then return to these user behaviors in the discussion with a more concrete implication, in â€œAdvantages of a Second Screenâ€ù: \ â€œThe range of participantsâ€™ engagement with the navigation functionalities would suggest their usefulness as part of a â€œperformance guideâ€ù, extending non-interactive show information that are the standard means for providing additional content to visitors. This guide could additionally include the before mentioned â€œdirected viewâ€ù and replay functionalities, features planned but not yet implemented in the prototype studied here.â€ù  \  \ We will adjust the structure of the discussion to reflect these additions of more HCI-specific contributions, e.g. change the final headline to â€œLessons for Designâ€ù, including both more specific and general lessons. \ DONE \  \ R2 comments that the study relies more on interviews than on video analysis,  \ and R3 correctly notes that the delay should have been stated in the architecture description DONE. \  \ In the method description, we will clarify that the study is primarily based on interviews. Analysis of video recordings were a complement to support these, and to uncover viewing and interaction patterns in addition to what participants themselves stated, though not at the level of a transcribed interaction analysis, which was out of the scope of the study. We will include the delay in the system architecture, as well as the placement of the omnidirectional camera. \ DONE  \ ADDED A SECTION \  \ R1 calls for a discussion on the impact of a number of visible screens in a small audience, as well as about sharing content with others. \ NOT DONE, defended this in the rebuttal. \  \ The 2nd AC reviewer asked: \  \ Something that I wished was clearer is the description of the actual \   performance, particularly in relation to the audience, not only in terms \   of what happens on stage, but also in terms of performance/audience \   relationship, e.g. were the performers at a constant distance from the \   audience? etc. \ DONE \  \ Hope this makes enough sense :-) \  \ ",games,Louise Barkhuus,Arvid EngstrÃ¶m,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:39,pn2203,A,Partially Intelligent Automobiles and Driving Experience at the Moment of System Transition,Key Jung,Lee,keyjlee@stanford.edu,pn2203-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Key Jung Lee, Yeon Kyoung Joo, Clifford Nass","keyjlee@stanford.edu, jusibel@stanford.edu, nass@stanford.edu",17655,Key Jung,,Lee,keyjlee@stanford.edu,,Stanford University,Palo Alto,California,United States,,,,,,11637,Yeon Kyoung,,Joo,jusibel@stanford.edu,,Stanford University,Palo Alto,California,United States,,,,,,2543,Clifford,,Nass,nass@stanford.edu,,Stanford University,Palo Alto,California,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The current study (N = 49) took a user-centered approach to explore how level of automation (pedal automated, wheel automated or fully automated driving) and the interface modality (switching automation on or off via touch or voice control) in automated vehicles influence driversâ€™ perceived experience and performance.

However, current approaches to crowd innovation rely on large numbers of contributors generating ideas independently in an unstructured way. We introduce a new approach called distributed analogical idea generation, which aims to make idea generation more effective and less reliant on chance. Drawing from the literature in cognitive science on analogy and schema induction, our approach decomposes the creative process in a structured way amenable to using crowds. In three experiments we show that distributed analogical idea generation leads to better ideas than example-based approaches, and investigate the conditions under which crowds generate good schemas and ideas.

In this work, we aim to gain insights from these â€œextreme users,â€ù who have used existing technologies and built their own workarounds to overcome different barriers. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 52 video recordings of Quantified Self Meetup talks to understand what they did, how they did it, and what they learned. We highlight several common pitfalls to self-tracking, including tracking too many things, not tracking triggers and context, and insufficient scientific rigor.

In particular, we studied user expectations of a hybrid tangible and gestural language engaging this space. Our main results include a vocabulary of user-defined gestures for interaction with active tokens, which extends beyond familiar multi-touch gestures; characterization of the design space of gestural interaction with active tokens; and insight into participantsâ€™ mental models, including common metaphors. We also present implications for the design of multi-touch and tangible interfaces with active tokens.

Much HCI research begins with an investigatory and analytic ethnographic approach before translating to design. Design may come much later in the process and may never benefit the community that is researched. However in many settings it is difficult for researchers to access the privileged ethnographer position of observer and investigator. Moreover rapid ethnographic research often does not seem the best or most appropriate course of action. \  \ We draw upon a project working with a remote Australian Aboriginal community to illustrate an alternative approach in Indigenous research, where the notion of reciprocity is first and foremost. We argue that this can lead to sustainable designs, valid research and profound innovation. \ ",Note,Paul Roe,p.roe@qut.edu.au,"1. Anderson, R. J.

However, the session creation process can be difficult and time-consuming due to the amount of expertise and effort required to consider alternative paper groupings. We present a collaborative web application called Frenzy to draw on the efforts and knowledge of an entire program committee. Frenzy comprises (a) interfaces to support large numbers of experts working collectively to create sessions, and (b) a two-stage process that decomposes the session-creation problem into meta-data elicitation and global constraint satisfaction. Meta-data elicitation involves a large group of experts working simultaneously, while global constraint satisfaction involves a smaller group that uses the meta-data to form sessions.  \  \ We evaluated Frenzy with 48 people during a deployment at the CSCW 2014 program committee meeting. The session making process was much faster than the traditional process, taking 88 minutes instead of a full day. We found that meta-data elicitation was useful for session creation. Moreover, the sessions created by Frenzy were the basis of the CSCW 2014 schedule. \ ",Paper,Lydia Chilton,hmslydia@gmail.com,"1. von Ahn, L., Dabbish, L. Labeling Images with a Computer Game.

As outlined in our rebuttal and per request of the reviewers we have added a more complete description of our system design, expanding and updating usage data, and adding a screenshot of the mobile application. We also added a paragraph clarifying the relationship between our design intervention and related applications in the harassment space (per references No. 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 25, 29). \ We have also worked harder to frame our contributions in relationship to theoretical concerns in the feminist HCI and HCI4D literatures, bring out with more clarity the challenges associated with HCI ethnographic and design interventions around deeply culturally contested issues like the ones tackled in this paper.  While the paper still straddles the line between immediate design contributions and a set of larger theoretical contributions, we hope that the contributions on both sides of this divide are now clearer and better integrated.  \ To make room for these changes and to improve clarity of description and argument throughout, we have substantially overhauled the writing throughout, compacting and clarifying parts of the ethnographic description, refining the discussion of user feedback and broader public responses, and producing what we believe is a much clearer organization of the findings and discussion sections. This includes a clearer (we hope) and more generalized contribution for researchers whose interests may lie beyond the immediate details of the case or specific design intervention. \ ",hci4d,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Steven Jackson,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:10,pn2227,A,Can Long Passwords be Secure and Usable?,Richard,Shay,rich@richshay.com,pn2227-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Richard Shay, Saranga Komanduri, Adam L.

Recent research has suggested, however, that policies requiring longer passwords with fewer additional requirements can be more usable and in some cases more secure than this traditional policy. To explore long passwords in more detail, we conducted an online experiment with 8,143 participants. Using a cracking algorithm modified for longer passwords, we evaluate eight policies across a variety of metrics for strength and usability. Among the longer policies, we discover new evidence for a security/usability tradeoff, with none being strictly better than another on both dimensions.  However, several policies are both more usable and more secure that the traditional policy we tested. Our analyses additionally reveal common patterns and strings found in cracked passwords.

Ranking tables order soccer teams represented as rows, according to values of columns containing attributes e.g., accumulated points, or number of scored goals.  Because they represent a snapshot of a championship at a time t, tables are regularly updated with new results.  Such updates usually change the rows order, which makes the tracking of a specified team over time difficult. We observed that the tables available on the web do not support tracking such changes very well, are generally hard to read, and lack interactions. This contrasts with the extensive use of comments on temporal trends found in soccer analysts articles. To better support such analyzes, the two interactive techniques presented allow exploration of time, and are designed to preserve users' flow: DRAG-CELL is based on direct manipulation of values to browse ranks; VIZ-RANK uses a transient line chart of team ranks to visually explore a championship. An on-line evaluation with 143 participants shows that each technique efficiently supports a set of important temporal tasks not supported by current ranking tables. This paves the way for introducing efficient advanced visual exploration techniques to millions of soccer enthusiasts who use tables everyday.",Paper,Charles Perin,charles.perin@inria.fr,"1.

We also made almost all additional changes and clarifications asked by the reviewers in order to increase the quality and clarity of the paper. These changes are detailed below: \  \ Related work: \ We simplified the formal definition of a rank, as R1 suggested. \  \ Paper contributions: \ we detailed the contributions at the end of the introduction \  \ Techniques: \ -We added the first paragraph in section: Novel Technique 1: Direct Manipulation of Values detailing the motivation for DC. \ -We extended the paragraph about discoverability of the techniques (second paragraph in DISCUSSION-Observation from Experiment and Main Findings) \  \ Tasks analysis: \ -We removed Table 1 and extended the textual description, as suggested by R3 (Section: Empirical Study of Soccer Ranking Tables) \ -Task taxonomy vocabulary: we added a paragraph (4th paragraph in section EMPIRICAL STUDY OF SOCCER RANKING TABLES - Time in Soccer Articles) introducing the vocabulary of the task taxonomy, with examples. \ -Task legitimacy: we added a paragraph (last paragraph in section EMPIRICAL STUDY OF SOCCER RANKING TABLES - Time in Soccer Articles) to explain the tasks legitimacy according to the analysis of articles and the expert rating of tasks. \  \ User study: \ -We changed the description of the user study as suggested R5 (CROWDSOURCED EVALUATION - Methodology) \ -Hypotheses: we reformulated H1, removed H2 and expressed better H[3,4,5,6], clarifying the technique we make the hypothesis on, and if the comparison is based on time or error. \ -We added the following information in Results - Quantitative results: When both DC and VR were triggered, we count the last interaction as the one that lead to the answer. \ -As advised R5, we removed Fig. 8, which was not really helpful and only kept Fig. 9 (now Fig. 8) which is more essential to understand the results. Removing this Figure allowed us to add more details in the discussion of the results. \  \ Discussion \ -We added two paragraphs (one for DC, one for VR) when discussing the hypothesis, relating back more to the data from the experiment and explaining for which task each technique performs well. (End of DISCUSSION - Observations from Experiment and Main Findings). We also explained that accuracy is more important than time. \ -We finally added a paragraph at the end of the discussion giving our interpretation of the results and relating them back to the task analysis and the tasks the two techniques were designed for as well as potential implications. \  \ Language and fixes: \ The entire paper was proofreaded by a native speaker, enhancing the writing and the overall clarity. \ -We fixed the incomplete bibliography entries (R2) \ ",,Charles Perin,Romain Vuillemot,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 22:33,pn2244,A,Making Sustainability Sustainable: Challenges in the Design of Eco-Interaction Technologies,Mark,Newman,mwnewman@umich.edu,pn2244-paper.pdf,10,letter,Arial-BoldMT TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT TimesNewRomanPSMT TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT CourierNewPSMT Arial-ItalicMT TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT ArialMT,,"Rayoung Yang, Mark Newman, Jodi Forlizzi","rayang@umich.edu, mwnewman@umich.edu, forlizzi@cs.cmu.edu",15481,Rayoung,,Yang,rayang@umich.edu,,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,Michigan,United States,,,,,,1425,Mark,,Newman,mwnewman@umich.edu,,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,Michigan,United States,,,,,,1028,Jodi,,Forlizzi,forlizzi@cs.cmu.edu,,Carnegie Mellon University,Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The smart home is here. One area where smart home devices promise to deliver great benefits is in the control of home heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems. In this paper, we seek to inform the design of future heating and cooling systems by investigating usersâ€™ experiences with the Nest Learning Thermostat, a commercially available smart home device. We conducted a qualitative study where we compared peopleâ€™s interactions with conventional thermostats with interactions with the Nest. A key finding was that the Nest impacted usersâ€™ pattern of HVAC control, but only for a while, and caused new problems in unrealized energy savings. In leveraging these findings, we create a set of design implications for Eco-Interaction, the design of features and human-system interactions with the goal of saving energy. \ ",Paper,Rayoung Yang,rayang@umich.edu,"1.

Future eco-interaction designs should seek to sustain user engagement.","We made the following changes with regard to the initial and additional reviews in the final version of this paper (summarized below): \  \ First, reviewers advised us to clarify the orientation, scope and implications of the study as compared to existing literatures. \ â€¢	In Introduction and in Discussion, we clarified our definition of Eco-Interaction. \ â€¢	We added Caveats and Limitations section and clarified the scope of our study and thus the direction taken by the design implications. We situated our work in the context of other relevant literature, such as Chappells and Shove (2005) and Clear, et al. (2013). In this section, we also added a disclaimer at the end to be careful with generalizing the findings, as advised by R1. \ â€¢	By clarifying the scope of the paper and improving the precision of our language, we addressed the â€œfraughtâ€ù statements identified by the AC.  \  \ Second, reviewers felt the benefit we gained from using the Product Ecology (PE) framework was not clear.  \ â€¢	On page 2, we expanded discussion of PE by adding a new, half page-long PRODUCT ECOLOGY ANALYSIS section. Here, we introduced PE with detail and frame the findings thereafter more clearly in terms drawn from PEâ€™s vocabulary. This strengthens the link between the PE Framework and findings.  \  \ Third, reviewers felt our use of the term â€œunsustainableâ€ù is confusing.  \ â€¢	We revised the statement, â€œThus, changes in behavior regarding thermostat control activities were unsustainable.â€ù Here (and throughout) we clarified that we meant to say that participantsâ€™ thermostat control practice changes, such as monitoring the energy history and fine-tuning the schedule for energy efficiency, did not last over time.  \ â€¢	We clarified our design implications by more carefully addressing R3â€™s concern about designs that strive for â€œkeeping householders in a constant state of 'awareness' about their activities.â€ù  \  \ We made other minor changes: \ â€¢	To make room for an expanded discussion of PE, our project scope, and our design implications, we cut back on the description of methods and the results of the conventional thermostat study.  \ â€¢	We removed repetitions in three sections identified by R3: the description of the Nest Learning Thermostat in Background and related work, the section 'Settling into a routine' and the Discussion section. \ â€¢	We made images in figure 2 and 3 bigger and used images that we obtained, with permission, from the Nest company in Figure 1.  \ â€¢	We eliminated typos, grammatical errors, and issues with references.  \ ",,Rayoung Yang,Mark Newman,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:10,pn2266,A,The Product of Availability: Understanding the Economic Underpinnings of Constant Connectivity,Melissa,Mazmanian,mmazmani@uci.edu,pn2266-paper.pdf,10,letter,Times-Roman,incomplete,"Melissa Mazmanian, Ingrid Erickson","mmazmani@uci.edu, ingrid.erickson@rutgers.edu",16412,Melissa,,Mazmanian,mmazmani@uci.edu,,"University of California, Irvine",Irvine,California,United States,,,,,,4210,Ingrid,,Erickson,ingrid.erickson@rutgers.edu,School of Communication & Information,Rutgers University,New Brunswick,New Jersey,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Constant connectivity and total availability to clients is the rule rather than the exception in many contemporary workplaces. Enabled by developments in information and communication technologies (ICTs), total availability of employees is possible and presumed. Scholars have explored how new technological affordances, cultural shifts, individual personality traits, and/or the development of social expectations that reinforce norms of constant connectivity have led to this state of affairs. We argue that a key factor has been overlooked in current scholarship about stress, intensive work, and constant connectivity. That is, current economic conditions are creating a marketplace in which firms increasing sell the availability of their employees as part of the services offered by the firm. In this paper we use qualitative data to illustrate how total availability is an integral aspect of the â€˜productâ€™ offered by professional service firms and is becoming increasingly prevalent in other service industries. We conclude with a discussion of how the HCI community might address this situation as a design challenge. Drawing on the work of Goffman and Perlow, we suggest that designers attend to the ways in which organizations might maintain front stage impressions of total availability while collectively managing individual time to restrict total availability behind the scenes.",Paper,Melissa Mazmanian,mmazmani@uci.edu,"1.

We try to understand the value of customization for individual families with children ages 6-12. We present interviews with creativity experts, a pilot study and a formal evaluation of families playing together in four conditions: separate windows, merged windows, digital play sets, and customized digital environments.

In an initial study we conducted structured interviews in grocery stores. Based on the results we implemented a system that visualized a householdâ€™s collective shopping information via situated displays. The aim was to raise awareness about shopping habits and to enable reflection about nutrition without burdening the users with the manual entry of their eating habits. We evaluated the system in a 4 week field study in 8 households with 21 users.

This results in games where players have limited opportunity to improve their physical skills, where there is little differentiation in peopleâ€™s physical abilities, and where skills do not change over the course of a game. To explore ways of adding these elements back into sports games, we developed two games with small-scale physical controls for running and throwing â€“ one game was a simple running race, and one was a team-based handball-style game called Jelly Polo. In two studies (three track-and-field tournaments for the running game, and a four-week league for Jelly Polo), we observed the effects of physical controls on gameplay. Our studies showed that the physical controls enabled substantial individual differences in running and passing skill, allowed people to increase their expertise over time, and led to fatigue-based changes in performance during a game. Physical controls increased the gamesâ€™ challenge, complexity, and unpredictability, and dramatically improved player interest, expressiveness, and enjoyment. Our work shows that game designers should consider the idea of â€˜exertion in the smallâ€™ as a way to improve play experience in games based on physical activities.",Paper,Mike Sheinin,mike.sheinin@usask.ca,"1.

Parent responses are parsed automatically and written into a central database that can be accessed via the web. We deployed @BabySteps with 14 parents over a 3-week period and found that parents were able to learn how to use the system to track their childrenâ€™s progress, with some using it to communicate with other parents.

Study findings have implications for using Twitter for interactive public health applications.","We would like to thank the reviewers, AC, and 2AC once again for their time and effort. With the help of their valuable feedback, we made the following changes: \  \ - In order to clearly state why we chose Twitter for our study, we added a paragraph in Introduction. \ 	â€œA recent study [16] suggests that integrating a health intervention into social sites that people already visit can increase adherence. Although parents are often too busy to remember to complete baby books or other manual tracking systems [11], they are already using social networking systems to share information on their children [15]. Inspired by earlier studies, our first approach has been to develop a tool to automatically prompt parents via Twitter to respond to questionnaires about their child, which can be stored in a centralized database.â€ù \  \ - We updated Figure 1 and included other technologies we mentioned in RELATED WORK. \  \ - To explain how we considered privacy and possible parental stress into our design, we added short paragraphs about them. \ 	â€œAlso, because we acknowledge that privacy can be of concern to parents, we encouraged our participants to check their accountâ€™s privacy settings. We also did not limit the form of response â€“ it could be a reply to our tweet, a new tweet, a re-tweet, or a direct message. That way, participants have the ultimate say in what they want to share publicly vs. privately.â€ù [PRIVACY - DEPLOYMENT STUDY DESIGN] \ 	â€œTo reduce any unnecessary parental stress, we explained in recruitment materials that development is variable with a wide range of what is typical as children grow in different areas at different rates.â€ù [PARENTAL STRESS - DEPLOYMENT STUDY DESIGN] \ 	â€œSecond, because Twitter remains in the public domain, privacy can be a critical issue. We cannot expect all of our users to have a strong level of media literacy. Therefore, it is important for us not only to inform them about the risk in advance, but also to give them options that they can choose and control privacy. Our future work is exploring alternatives to Twitter to track milestones, so for those who are not comfortable with using this method, they have several other options.â€ù [PRIVACY - DISCUSSION] \  \ -We also added two sentences into the INTRODUCTION that explained that while milestone-based screening has some limitations, they are currently the most effective method for screening large numbers of children and included a citation. \ 	â€œThere are some limitations to using milestone questionnaires for screening, such as child variability or the potential for parent anxiety. However, they are currently the most effective method for screening according to the American Academy of Pediatrics [4].â€ù \  \ - We fixed editorial mistakes and added an acknowledgements section.",,Hyewon Suh,Julie Kientz,,ContentComplete,FormatComplete,9/18/14 19:49,pn2293,A,Learning to See the Body: Supporting Instructional Practices in Laparoscopic Surgical Procedures,Helena,Mentis,mentis@umbc.edu,pn2293-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Helena M.

Namely, we added that we aimed to expose the techno-mediated practices of surgical instruction and learning in using endoscopic video.  This is important due to the increasing use of images in minimally invasive surgery and opportunities for design of mechanisms for interaction around those videos, but also more broadly for our understanding of how video seeing practices (in any domain) are not without work. In addition, we further addressed design implications requested by the AC and R3, namely with regards to our own on-going work on the design of technological augmentation through simulation systems as well as through in situ video annotation in a special subsection in the discussion. \  \ With regards to prior work, we specifically refered to Koschmann et al 2011 as R3 suggested.  Our aim in bringing to bear Koschmann's work is to show the importance of the interpretive nature of seeing and the effect it has over action.  With our work, then, we show the importance of teaching one to see with its effect on prospective action.  In addition, we show the manipulation of video itself as a mechanism for guiding this seeing.  We then link these insights to future aims for training simulations as well as in situ augmentation devices. \  \ Finally we referenced Mondada 2003 in the section, Training Surgeons to See, using it as evidence that surgeons consciously display their actions towards a recipient in the use of the endoscopic video.  This allows our findings to build on that work and specifically address how they display these actions for learning. \  \ We also clarified in our methods that the authors in this study engaged in both observations and interviews and then their analysis process was an inductive & iterative thematic analysis followed by member checking for validity.",,Helena Mentis,Amine Chellali,,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:36,pn2294,A,The Doing of Doing Stuff: Understanding the Coordination of Social Group-Activities,Richard,Schuler,qberticus@gmail.com,pn2294-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Richard P Schuler, Sukeshini A Grandhi, Julia M Mayer, Steve T Ricken, Quentin (Gad) Jones","rps22@njit.edu, grandhis@easternct.edu, julia.marlene.mayer@gmail.com, steve.ricken@gmail.com, quentin.jones@njit.edu",8239,Richard,P,Schuler,rps22@njit.edu,,New Jersey Institute of Technology,Newark,New Jersey,United States,,,,,,35234,Sukeshini,A,Grandhi,grandhis@easternct.edu,,Eastern Connecticut State University,Willimantic,Connecticut,United States,,,,,,34700,Julia,M,Mayer,julia.marlene.mayer@gmail.com,,New Jersey Institute of Technology,Newark,New Jersey,United States,,,,,,34994,Steve,T,Ricken,steve.ricken@gmail.com,,New Jersey Institute of Technology,Newark,New Jersey,United States,,,,,,2841,Quentin (Gad),,Jones,quentin.jones@njit.edu,,New Jersey Institute of Technology,Newark,New Jersey,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper explores how the adoption of mobile and social computing technologies has impacted upon the way in which we coordinate social group-activities. We present a diary study of 36 individuals that provides an overview of how group coordination is currently performed as well as the challenges people face. Our findings highlight that people primarily use open-channel communication tools (e.g., text messaging, phone calls, email) to coordinate because the alternatives are seen as either disrupting or curbing to the natural conversational processes. Yet the use of open-channel tools often results in conversational overload and a significant disparity of work between coordinating individuals. This in turn often leads to a sense of frustration and confusion about coordination details. We discuss how the findings argue for a significant shift in our thinking about the design of coordination support systems.",Paper,Richard Schuler,qberticus@gmail.com,"1.

This has been very helpful in making this a stronger paper. We have made the following changes in response to this feedback. \  \ 1) Addressed the grammar and copyediting issues that were present in the original submission. We have also clarified the language in many places to improve the readability of the paper as a whole. \  \ 2) Included more information about the various technologies that were used by the study participants and their common issues (contained in Table 1, pg. 7). In the discussion we addressed how the design and use of these technologies impacted our findings. This is done throughout the discussion section but specifically addressed in paragraph 4 of this section (pg. 8).  \  \ 3) We provide a definition of group as it relates to the paper and our findings. We explain that we do not use any single theoretical definition of group and instead rely on the more colloquial definition of a group being a collection of 2 or more people. (1st paragraph of the introduction) \  \ 4) We explain our use of paper diaries and why there was a large range in interview times (changes contained in the Method sectionâ€™s 1st paragraph, pg. 4). \  \ 5) We address the issues with the theory discussion section to clarify our position on not assuming any single theoretical perspective. (1st paragraph of the Theories of Social Group-Activity Coordination sub-section) In our discussion of relevant theories we extended our discussion to small group communication theories and how they relate and compare to the theories used by CSCW and HCI researchers. We further discuss their similarities and deficiencies and also acknowledge and discuss the gap between the two dominate perspectives on communication and coordination This was done by (i) restructuring the entire â€œTheories of Social Group-Activity Coordination â€œsub-section of the paper (pg. 3) and; (ii) clarifying the background summary. \  \ 6) We reduced the number of references. This provide the space required to extend the examination of theory and how it relates to this research and also allowed us to extend the discussion of the design and use of the various technologies in the discussion section. \  \ We believe we have addressed all issues raised by the reviewers and will be happy to make any other specific changes that you perceive as required.  Thank you once again for your support and constructive comments.  \  \ Sincerely, \ Rich, Suki, Quentin, Julia, Steve \ ",,Richard Schuler,Sukeshini Grandhi,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:51,pn2303,A,TurningPoint: Narrative-Driven Presentation Planning,Larissa,Pschetz,larissa@entretags.de,pn2303-paper.pdf,4,letter,,,"Larissa Pschetz, Koji Yatani, Darren Edge","lpschetz@ed.ac.uk, koji@microsoft.com, darren.edge@microsoft.com",33244,Larissa,,Pschetz,lpschetz@ed.ac.uk,,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,Beijing,China,,,,,,9633,Koji,,Yatani,koji@microsoft.com,,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,Beijing,China,,,,,,9574,Darren,,Edge,darren.edge@microsoft.com,,Microsoft Research Asia,Beijing,Beijing,China,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Once upon a time, people told stories unencumbered by slides.

However, the standard mediums for circuit design and construction remain the breadboard, protoboard, and printed circuit board (PCB).   As an alternative, we introduce a method in which circuits are hand-made on ordinary paper substrates, connected with conductive foil tape and off-the-shelf circuit components with the aim of supporting the durability, scalability, and accessibility needs of novice and expert circuit builders alike.   We also used electrified notebooks to investigate how the circuit design and build process would be affected by the constraints and affordances of the bound book.  Our ideas and techniques were evaluated through a series of workshops, through which we found our methods supported a wide variety of approaches and resultsâ€”both technical and expressiveâ€” to electronics design and construction.",Paper,Jie Qi,jieqi@media.mit.edu,"1.

We present a novel technique that we have employed to examine alignment in an open-ended educational game.

We rewrote the analysis section to better explain the technique and frame the approach of analyzing clusters to better align with the language we used in our rebuttal. We added comments calling out and explaining the issue of frequency use within the method. We softened the wording of the contribution statements to make it sound less like we were presenting a rigorously validated method and instead presenting a case study of a technique that we have found useful. We also removed the contribution statement related to design recommendations , clarified the claims about contributions in terms of the EDGE framework, and drew better distinctions between the current work and our previous work. \ Additionally, we included the reference about construct irrelevant variance that was provided by R1. We removed the reference about automatic level generation as it mainly seemed to confuse readers about the purposed of our technique by comparison.

Instead of files, skWiki uses the concept of paths as trajectories of persistent state over time. This model has intrinsic support for collaborative editing, including cloning, branching, and merging paths edited by multiple contributors. We demonstrate skWiki's utility using a qualitative, sketching-based user study.  \ ",Paper,Sriram Karthik Badam,sbadam@purdue.edu,"1. Baecker, R. M.

The differential value given to expert versus lay knowledge is a central factor in these debates. We apply Artifact Analysis, developed to help designers handle the complexity of digital artifacts, as a method to explore how experts and non-experts understand and frame robots, a technology characterized by significant complexity. Our results show that both non-expert users and expert researchers have knowledge that is significant to future robot development, but they focus on different aspects of the technologyâ€”users address mediated and interaction complexity while researchers focus on internal and external complexity. We also found that robots function as boundary objects between experts and users, and suggest that one task designers can perform is to â€œstay on the boundaryâ€ù and mediate between the different ways in which experts and non-experts frame emerging technology to develop designs that benefit from insights from both user and researcher perspectives.",Note,Hee Rin Lee,hrl@indiana.edu,"WARNING: Reference 7 starts with a non-alphanumeric character.

We use the different forms of complexity[5] to categorize how our participants describe and critique robots, and to point out differences, similarities, and complementarities of their viewpoints that can inform robot design. In describing our study, we refer to participants as researchers/experts and users/non-experts, and to the broader HCI community as designers. We are specifically interested in understanding how robotics researchers with diverse backgroundsâ€”designers, social scientists, computer scientistsâ€”and various users approach robots. While we do not generalize from our results to designers more broadly, we hope that the methodological approach will contribute to the HCI community interested in the relationship between users and researchers and in critical and collaborative methods for technology design. \  \ Also, we change our subtitles from â€œthe knowledge of researchersâ€ù to â€œEpistemic Framing of Robots by Researchers and Usersâ€ù to tone down our claims regarding knowledge and focus more on interpretations by researchers and users.

Due to the veracity of social media, imperfections in prediction algorithms, and the sensitive nature of oneâ€™s personal traits, much research is still needed to better understand the effectiveness of this line of work, including usersâ€™ preferences of sharing their computationally derived traits. In this paper, we report a two- part study involving 256 participants, which (1) examines the feasibility and effectiveness of automatically deriving three types of personality traits from Twitter, including Big 5 personality, basic human values, and fundamental needs, and (2) investigates usersâ€™ opinions of using and sharing these traits. Our findings show there is a potential feasibility of automatically deriving oneâ€™s personality traits from social media with various factors impacting the accuracy of models, and the trait of basic human values outperforms the models of Big 5 personality and fundamental needs. The results also indicate over 61.5% users are willing to share their derived traits in the workplace and that a number of factors significantly influence their sharing preferences. Since our findings demonstrate the feasibility of automatically inferring a userâ€™s personal traits from social media, we discuss their implications for designing a new generation of privacy-preserving, hyper-personalized systems.",Paper,Liang Gou,lgou@us.ibm.com,"1.

We emphasized that the adoption of RVCA is one of our contributions to assess and explain the overall confidence for the accuracy of 3 computational models (and others alike).  \  \ (b) We explained how we minimized the interaction effects of selfâ€“assessment evaluation (AC) in Study Design section.  \  \ (c) We included more analysis in privacy preference study.  \ We included more details (the independent/dependable variables, model fitness) about the generalized linear mixed model used for the factor analysis (page 5).  In addition, two important factor analyses were added: 1). how the â€œtrueâ€ù personality (from psychometric tests) affects the usersâ€™ privacy preferences (page 6); 2). how the different perceived risks and benefits impact the sharing preferences (page 7); \  \ 2. We explained the three models in more details to appeal to a broader CHI audience in Method section (page 3). As AC suggested, we explained the computational trait models with examples and their use. We also include more references of our related work, since our paper is on the evaluation of these models, not on the model building. \  \ 3. We included more description about the test population (characteristics, representativeness, and constraints by the study requirements), and explained the high incompletion rate.    \  \ 4.

The results show that right-oriented movements were faster and easier than left-oriented ones.

"" \ =>	See R2 comments \ -------------------------------- \ 4. Related work. R1 and R2 both have suggestions for additional related \    work that would strengthen the paper.""	 \ =>	See R1 comments \  \  \ ============================================ \ Review 1 \ ============================================ \ First of all, the experiment seems to have too few conditions in the task \    space---only two data points in each direction of translation or \    rotation---so that the results may not be generalizable to our everyday \    multi-touch tasks. Human hands can do almost 270 degree rotation (based \    on the launching posture), but this paper only sample the 50 and 130 \    degree points.  \ => We carefully considered this. Due to combinatorics we decided to use only two values for translation and rotation and relied on a similar design by Hoffman et al. (2013, Ergonomics) for 1D Interaction. Stoelen and Akin used for a similar experiment with 13 participants, 16 configurations and 12 repetitions for each configuration (192 trials) (2010, Human Factors).  \ We argue this in subsection Experimental Design (p. 2). \ -------------------------------- \  \ I appreciated the observation and analysis of user operation strategies, which has many influences on design. However, this paper does not discuss the effect of tolerance on the task performance. It seems that the tolerance conditions are irrelevant to this paper.  I suggest using a proper single fixed tolerance for the experiment and adding more conditions for translation and rotation.  \ => What we call tolerance is also known as width (= W) and is an integral part of the ID formula. We followed Guiardâ€™s (2009) suggestion to include all values A, W and A/W. Therefore, we varied tolerance. \  \ -------------------------------- \ The display was presented to the participants at an angle of *about* 45 degrees. Please indicate the exact angle. More importantly, 45 degrees seems too large for setting up a tabletop ergonomically. Artists usually tilt their desks from 15 to 25 degrees; for most of our daily usage of tablets, we put the display almost horizontally. The authors need to explain why 45 degree angle was chosen. \ => Position of Device \ The decision to position the display with 50 degrees relative to a vertical display was based on feedback from pre-studies where we explicitly asked about visibility and comfort. The display was on a low table and this angle was considered optimal by the participants. \ Change in final version:  \ This was described clearer in subsection Apparatus (p. 2)"" \  \ -------------------------------- \ The visual cues for indicating the manipulation angle and position, a line between index finger and thumb, may distract the participants, because such visual feedback is not in a usual form of common interfaces. It is better to make it a rectangle, mimicking the manipulation of photos  or other objects. Also, the dash lines shown on the display are interrupting in the experiment, which may mislead the participants. For \    example, in Fig1(b)(c), I have difficulties in understanding what are the \    starting and ending postures. If solid lines indicate the starting position and dash lines indicate the target, how do you place your hand initially in Fig1(b)(c)?   \ => Visualisation of interface \ We agree that the visualisation could be confusing for naive users. In our studies we found it to be no problem for the participants to recognize start and end point, because the handles were positioned in the start area. In Fig. 1 arrows indicate the start and end point. \ Change in final version: \ We agree that the figures were overloaded, so we exchanged the figures with the original visualtion of the experiment. \ The decrease the size of the arrow ends. \  \ Changes were made in Figure 1. \  \ -------------------------------- \ Also, I donâ€™t understand how the authors calculated the task ID with Shannonâ€™s formula, since the task here is very different from the original 1D Fittsâ€™ task in MacKenzieâ€™s paper. 	""Shannon formula for ID \ => We used the Shannon formula because it has been advocated by many researchers investigating Fittsâ€™ Law (e.g. Blanch and Ortega, CHI 2011, and Guiard, CHI 2009) including MacKenzie. We consider our task to be quite similar to his design (except for our adding rotation). \  \ Change in final version: \ We explained it in subsection â€_Experimental Designâ€œ (p. 2)"" \  \ -------------------------------- \ The authors also claimed that their findings could allow a more precise formulation of Fittsâ€™ law. But how? There is not enough discussion about this issue. I suggest the authors tamper down this claim. \ => Change in final version: \ We discussed our idea in Section â€_Conclusion and Future Workâ€œ."" \  \ -------------------------------- \ There are also some missing references that would be interesting to include into the paper.  \  \ - On object manipulation and its simultaneity: [1] Wang, Y., MacKenzie, C.

(p. 1)"" \  \ -------------------------------- \ The distance between the users' fingers was obviously not controlled in this experiment (as can be seen from the strategies). The authors might explicitly state this. \ =>Distance between fingers \ In the pre-studies we fixed the distance, but the participants wished more flexibility in finger distance, because in some cases the fixed distance lead to uncomfortable poses, so that they lifted the finger up which caused errors. \  \ Change in final version: \ We described it much clearer in subsection â€_Procedureâ€œ (p. 2) "" \  \ -------------------------------- \ One thing that is really missing is a clear description of how the strategies were classified. Is this an automatic technique or is it done by human eyeballing? Is it likely to be consistent? \ => Classification of strategies \ The classification was done manually by eyeballing the recorded paths. Most of the paths were clear and easy to classify. Just few of them were more difficult to categorize (e.g. if the path was short and flat). Such kind of paths were discussed by two people at least. \  \ Change in final version: \ We tried to explain it clearer in paragraph â€_Used strategiesâ€œ (p. 3)"" \  \ -------------------------------- \ The results are obviously only valid for a very specific task (horizontal translation with rotation to vertical), and might be quite different for \    different terminal orientations or different movement directions. As this \    is a note with a very focused goal, this is not really a problem, but the \    author's might note the domain of the study more clearly."" \ => Change in final version: \ Similar to Hoggan et al. such results can provide as aids in designing interaction designs and devices. \  \ We add Hoggan et al. as related work (p. 1) \  \  \ ============================================ \ Review 3 \ ============================================ \  \ During object manipulation, it is necessary sometimes to translate and rotate them at the same time. It might be interesting to know how long such a manipulation would take, but usually the arrangement of the elements cannot be predetermined (as it essentially depends on what the users want to do with the data), and as such this aspect of the paper is weak. \ =>Change in final version: \ Our study intends to fill a gap in existing work by systematically examining the effects of combining translation and rotation under varying conditions and looking at execution strategies by the users. We took Stoelen and Akinâ€™s experimental design and varied movement direction. We evaluated performance, subjective impression and choice of strategy. (see p. 1) \  \ -------------------------------- \ Presentation clarity: Mixed. The paper is well-written, employs good style, and is generally \    free of typos. However, I find it awkward to use the terms left and right \    to refer to rotations; CW and CCW would be clearer; and will remove the \    confusion as to which letter in the pair (LL, LR ... ) refers to rotation \    and which to translation. \ => Change in final version: \ We add an alternative descriptin in brackets in the description and an addition paragraph where we explain what LL, LR etc. means  (see section Experiment p.2) \  \ -------------------------------- \ Also, it is not explained in the paper how the distance in the translation component of the motion is defined (between which and which points). \ => Change in final version:  \ We define the distance as shortest path from the starting point to the line in the end area. \ (see section Experiment p.2) \  \ -------------------------------- \ Finally, as already mentioned, the statistical analysis is usually expected in papers of this kind. \ => Change in final version:  \ In section â€_Resultsâ€œ we add the results of our MANOVA analysis (p. 3)"" \  \ -------------------------------- \ Validity: Mixed. There are multiple claims like """"significant difference"""" / \    """"significantly faster"""".

Despite photos' pervasive presence in social media and online world, we know little about how people interact and engage with their content. Understanding how photo content might signify engagement, can impact both science and design, influencing \ production and distribution. One common type of photo content that is shared on social media, is the photos of people.  \ From studies of offline behavior, we know that human faces are powerful channels of non-verbal communication. In this paper, we study this behavioral phenomena online. We ask how \ presence of a face, it's age and gender might impact social engagement on the \ photo. We use a corpus of 1M Instagram images and organize our study around two \ social engagement feedback factors, likes and comments. Our results show that photos with faces are 38% more likely to \ receive likes and 32% more likely to receive comments, even after \ controlling for social network reach and activity.  We find, however, \ that the number of faces, their age and gender do not have an \ effect. This work presents the first results on how photos with human faces relate to engagement on large scale image \ sharing communities.

These fatalities represent approximately 5% of all highway deaths each year, yet motorcycles account for only 2% of all registered vehicles in the United States. Motorcyclists are highly exposed on the road, so maintaining situational awareness at all times is crucial. Route guidance systems enable users to efficiently navigate between locations using dynamic visual maps and audio directions, and have been well tested with motorists, but remain unsafe for use by motorcyclists. Audio/visual routing systems decrease motorcyclists' situational awareness and vehicle control, and thus elevate chances of an accident. To enable motorcyclists to take advantage of route guidance while maintaining situational awareness, we created HaptiMoto, a wearable haptic route guidance system. HaptiMoto uses tactile signals to encode the distance and direction of approaching turns, thus avoiding interference with audio/visual awareness. Our evaluations demonstrate that HaptiMoto is both intuitive and a safer alternative for motorcyclists compared to existing solutions.",Paper,Manoj Prasad,manoj.prasad@neo.tamu.edu,"1.

The number of these pulses encode the relative distance to an upcoming turn, and the duration between pulses and the number of these pulses are dimensions that serve to encode the sense of urgency or nearness to that turn [64,65]."" \  \ Added a line to relate user errors to previous work. Added a line to Discussion section Pg8 C2 Para1 Ln2 - â€ùThe errors indicate that motorcyclists require a minimum duration of time to make a turn [33,37]. Otherwise, when the direction cues are presented within the ideal lead distance from the turn, they are more probable to miss the turn [10].â€ù \  \ Added a paragraph to explain how the results relate to prior work in haptics and navigation systems. Discussion section (Pg8 C2 Para2) - â€ùOur results support haptic vests viability as a motorcyclist navigation interface, which employs the co-location of haptic cues and target direction [26,49] and the encoding of warning lead distance with pulse count [10,22]. Overall, we observed twelve user errors in the study due to weak contact between the users body and tactors, as similarly noted in [28,61,29]. Turning direction accuracy also shows the discreteness and clearness of the haptic cues, with minimal interference from vehicle vibration noise [53]. Participants had suggested using a continuous vibrotactile signal instead of a three-pulse signal shortly prior to turning. However, our rationale for not implementing a continuous signal in this case is that it would distract the motorcyclists attention away from the road and could also be perceived as annoying [30].â€ù \  \ Added a line, in Future Work section (Pg 9 C1 Para1 Ln4), to state that future work will include navigating users through complex junctions - ""Lastly, we would like to test HaptiMoto for navigation through complex junctions"" \  \ Added a paragraph to Related Work section- Human Factors Research in Tactile Interfaces sub-section (Pg2 C2 Para3) - â€ù Poppinga et al. [44] designed Tacticycle, an interface using a combination of visual and tactile medium to navigate bicyclists. Tacticycle uses drift to destination for guiding bicyclists to provide direction of destination in relation to users orientation like a compass, but not designed to efficiently navigate between two locations, warn the riders of upcoming turns. Tacticycles typical use cases were also limited to short routes and slow navigation. Steltenpohl and Bouwer [56] designed a vibrotactile belt to provide turn-by-turn navigation signal for bicyclists signals are provided at 50m and 10m before the turn. We contend that bicyclists are similar to pedestrians; bicyclists have ample time to respond to navigation cues due to much slower travel speeds and can more easily pull over to the side of the road to confirm navigational aspects. Vehicle speed also determines when a rider needs to be warned of upcoming turns; low speeds and small variations in bicyclists speed lets designers signal riders at predefined distances before a turn (Vibrobelt), but motorcyclists can ravel anywhere between 10-75mph. Motorcyclists though cannot afford to be distracted by navigation cues due to higher average and range of speeds, especially since they share the travel speed hazards of automobilists and exposed vulnerabilities of bicyclists and pedestrians. The vibrotactors positions in Tacticycles steering bar and Vibrobelts surface are not appropriate stimulus locations for motorcyclists since these will increase change blindness [23], discussed in detail further below in this section.â€ù \  \ Following the above changes as requested by the reviewers, made thorough proofreading edits to ensure that the paper was free from spelling, grammar, and flow issues.",,Manoj Prasad,Tracy Hammond,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:45,pn2424,A,Permulin: Mixed-Focus Collaboration on Multi-View Tabletops,Jochen,Huber,jhuber@mit.edu,pn2424-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Roman Lissermann, Jochen Huber, Martin Schmitz, JÃ_rgen Steimle, Max MÃ_hlhÃ_user","lissermann@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de, jhuber@mit.edu, mschmitz@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de, jsteimle@mpi-inf.mpg.de, max@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de",16664,Roman,,Lissermann,lissermann@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de,,Technische UniversitÃ_t Darmstadt,Darmstadt,,Germany,,,,,,13636,Jochen,,Huber,jhuber@mit.edu,,MIT Media Lab,Cambridge,MA,USA,,Singapore University of Technology and Design,Singapore,,Singapore,39039,Martin,,Schmitz,mschmitz@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de,,Technische UniversitÃ_t Darmstadt,Darmstadt,,Germany,,,,,,9521,JÃ_rgen,,Steimle,jsteimle@mpi-inf.mpg.de,,Max Planck Institute for Informatics,SaarbrÃ_cken,,Germany,,,,,,5807,Max,,MÃ_hlhÃ_user,max@informatik.tu-darmstadt.de,,Technische UniversitÃ_t Darmstadt,Darmstadt,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We contribute Permulin, an integrated set of interaction and visualization techniques for multi-view tabletops to support co-located collaboration across a wide variety of collaborative coupling styles.

The section has a new structure and focuses on situating our work in the field of CSCW. We also removed Figure 2 as requested by the reviewers. \  \ ###Section: Permulin Concept and Prototype \ We clarified the hand recognition we used for personalized touch input to clarify possible misunderstandings mentioned by reviewers. (Last paragraph) \  \ Section: Interaction and Visualization Techniques \ As suggested in the rebuttal, we clarified the scalability of our IAT by revising our explanation of the interaction techniques â€œMerge and Divide Viewsâ€ù, as well as Peeking; i.e. both paragraphs in Divide and Merge View in subsection â€œFluid Transition between Group and Individual Workâ€ù as well as subsection â€œAwareness and Coordination during Individual Workâ€ù last paragraph of peeking. Previously misleading Figure 4 with respect to scalability was improved to illustrate how divide and merge work for each user. \  \ ###Section: Evaluation \ We followed the advice of R1 and fully revised the subsection â€œ Coordination and Flexible Transitioning on Permulinâ€ù to clarify and explain the usage of the proposed interaction techniques. Also, we followed R1â€™s advice to not include the statistical/quantitative analysis for the interaction techniques. Instead, we opted for a qualitative and descriptive analysis of how coordination and transitioning techniques relate to time spent in e.g. divided or merged views. To underline this, we added an exemplary illustration (Figure 10) that shows how one of the groups employed the techniques throughout one of the tight collaboration tasks on Permulin. The figure highlights the different phases of the collaboration and illustrates the application of coordination techniques (to scaffold workspace awareness), as well as transitioning techniques.  \  \ Headers of Table 4 were slightly modified, stating that a 5-point Likert scale was used. \  \  \  \  \ ",,Roman Lissermann,Jochen Huber,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 19:45,pn2432,A,Mouse Pointing Endpoint Prediction Using Kinematic Template Matching,Jacob,Wobbrock,wobbrock@u.washington.edu,pn2432-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Phillip T.

While prior approaches to endpoint prediction have relied upon normative kinematic laws, regression, or control theory, our approach is straightforward but kinematically rich. Our key insight is to regard the unfolding velocity profile of a pointing movement as a 2-D stroke gesture and to use template matching to predict the endpoint based on prior observed movements. We call our technique kinematic template matching (KTM), which is simple to implement, user-adaptable, and kinematically expressive. In a study of 17 able-bodied participants evaluated over movement amplitudes ranging from 100-800 pixels, we found KTM to predict endpoints that were within 83 pixels of the true endpoint at 50% of the way through the movement, within 48 pixels at 75%, and within 39 pixels at 90%, using 1000 templates per participant. These accuracies make KTM as successful an approach to endpoint prediction as any prior technique, while being easier to implement and understand than most.",Paper,Jacob O.

For tutorial authors, it simplifies the tutorial creation. For tutorial users, it provides contextual step-by-step guidance and avoids the frequent context switching between tutorials and users' primary tasks. In order to generate the tutorials automatically, EverTutor records low-level touch events to detect gestures and identify on-screen targets. When a tutorial is browsed, the system uses vision-based techniques to locate the target regions and overlays the corresponding input prompt contextually. It also identifies the correctness of users' interaction to guide the users step by step. We conducted a 6-person user study for creating tutorials and a 12-person user study for browsing tutorials, and we compared EverTutor's interactive tutorials to static and video ones. Study results show that creating tutorials by EverTutor is simpler and faster than producing static and video tutorials. Also, when using the tutorials, the task completion time for interactive tutorials were 3-6 times faster than static and video tutorials regardless of age group.

The default icon libraries found in visualization tools often do not match the semantics of the data. Users often manually search for or create icons that are more semantically meaningful. This process can hinder the flow of visual analysis, especially when the amount of data is large, leading to a suboptimal user experience. We propose a technique for automatically generating semantically relevant icon encodings for categorical dimensions of data points. The algorithm employs natural language processing in order to find relevant imagery from the Internet. We evaluate our approach on Mechanical Turk by generating large libraries of icons using Tableau Public workbooks that represent real analytical effort by people out in the world. Our results show that the automatic algorithm does nearly as well as the manually created icons, and particularly has higher user satisfaction for larger cardinalities of data.",Paper,Vidya Setlur,vidya.setlur@gmail.com,"WARNING: Reference 24 is very long.

When targets are large and sparse, the Bubble Lens behaves like the Bubble Cursor. But when targets are small and dense, the Bubble Lens automatically magnifies nearby targets, making them larger in both visual- and motor-space. Importantly, magnification is not governed by an explicit user-invoked mode-switch. Rather, magnification is activated through kinematic triggering, a technique that continuously examines an unfolding velocity profile to automatically trigger mode changes based on observed features. In a first study, we found the Bubble Cursor performed poorly when targets had an effective size smaller than 10 pixels. Using this threshold for the Bubble Lens in a second study, we found that the Bubble Lens significantly outperformed the Bubble Cursor, decreasing movement time by 10.2% and error rates by 37.9%, making the Bubble Lens the fastest current pointing technique.",Paper,Jacob O.

Interactive whiteboards offer the potential for enhanced support for manipulating content, managing sketches, and distributed work, but little is known about how this support affects the practice of informal design. To understand the opportunities and challenges, we first conducted a literature review, identifying 14 behaviors that occur during informal design. We then designed an interactive whiteboard system to support all of these behaviors and deployed the system to three groups of designers. Through usage logs and interviews, we examined the effects of interactivity on whiteboard use across a wide spectrum of design behaviors, identifying ways in which interactive whiteboards support the practices used in physical whiteboards and where they enable designers to work more effectively.",Paper,Thomas LaToza,tlatoza@uci.edu,"1.

To address this, we present a flexible decoder for touchscreen text entry that combines probabilistic touch models with a language model. We investigate two different touch models. The first touch model is based on a Gaussian Process regression approach and implicitly models the inherent uncertainty of the touching process. The second touch model allows users to explicitly control the uncertainty via touch pressure. Using the first model we show that the character error rate can be reduced by up to 7% over a baseline method, and by up to 1.3% over a leading commercial keyboard. Using the second model we demonstrate that providing users with control over input certainty reduces the amount of text users have to correct manually and increases the text entry rate.",Paper,Daryl Weir,darylweir@gmail.com,"1.

We analyzed participantsâ€™ interactions with the nudges, the content of their posts, and opinions collected through surveys. We found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden; however, introducing a time delay before publishing usersâ€™ posts can be perceived as both beneficial and annoying.

We describe below how we addressed these comments in this new version.  \  \ Both AC and R1 rightly requested better motivations of the nudge design. We expanded the literature on behavioral biases and regretful behavior on social media, and explained how they motivated and informed our nudge designs. We also reorganized the related work section to better situate our work vis-Ã -vis the literature.  \  \ As requested by AC, R2, and R3, we expanded the descriptions of our specific nudge designs and how they were improved based on our pilot studies. We also added details about the implementation of our nudges and their technical limitations.   \   \ The AC and R1 noted our small sample size. We expanded the discussion on why it was particularly difficult to get a large sample for a longitudinal field trial like ours. We also explained why our study is still valuable, albeit the small sample size.  \  \ R2 asked about Hawthorne effect, which we had considered in our study design. We added a discussion on the Hawthorne effect and how we addressed it in our study. \  \ AC and R2 noted concerns regarding the studyâ€™s technical difficulties. We added a description of the major technical difficulties encountered in our study and explained how they affected our participants.  \  \ Many reviewers suggested improving the presentation of our results. We significantly simplified the participants table, as suggested by the shepherd. Both AC and R1 requested deeper reasons for the adoption or rejection of the nudge features. We trimmed down our statistical analyses and added a detailed participant-level analysis that shows how our nudges affected each individual participant. This participant-level analysis not only allowed us to demonstrate why the nudges were useful for and liked by some participants but not for others, but also to help tease apart the impact of the specific nudges (i.e., pictures and timer). \  \ Finally, as suggested by the AC, we expanded our discussion on how our study results can inform the design and evaluation of our nudges in other contexts.  \  \ ",,Yang Wang,Pedro Leon,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:21,pn2464,A,Both Complete and Correct?

Applying computational optimization methods, this work explores the optimality issues related to them. The work demonstrates that it is possible to simultaneously optimize a keyboard algorithm for both correction and completion. The keyboard simultaneously optimized for both introduces no compromise to correction and only a slight compromise to completion when compared to the keyboards exclusively optimized for one objective. Our research also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method in keyboard algorithm design, which is based on the Pareto multi-objective optimization and the Metropolis algorithm.  For the development and test datasets used in our experiments, computational optimization improved the correction accuracy rate by 8.3% and completion power by 17.7%.",Paper,Xiaojun Bi,xjunbi@gmail.com,"1.

We find that visually impaired users participate on Facebook (e.g. status updates, comments, likes) as much as the general population, and receive more feedback (i.e., comments and likes) on average on their content. By analyzing the content produced by visually impaired users, we find that they share their experience and issues related to vision impairment.

A more accurate source of data could be gained from wearable computing designed for physical therapy exercise support. Existing systems have been tested in the lab but we have little information about issues they may face in home settings. We designed a technology probe, SenseCap, and deployed it for seven days in ten physical therapy patientsâ€™ homes. SenseCap is a wearable physical therapy support system that gathers patient exercise compliance and performance data and summarizes the data in charts on an iPad Dashboard for physical therapists to view when patients return to the clinic. In this paper, we present the results of our deployment, show in-home patient exercise data gathered by the probe, and make design recommendations based on patient and physical therapist responses.

Clarify that the contribution is not the system, but rather the knowledge gained from its deployment.  \ a. Rephrase the contribution paragraph â€“ the last paragraph of Introduction - to emphasize this distinction. \ b. Remove â€œSenseCap:â€ù from the title, as mentioned by AC. The draft will include a re-worded title. \ c. Remove the second to last paragraph of Introduction (â€œSenseCap is self-containedâ€_â€ù) as it appears to emphasize the system as a contribution. Move the sentence regarding data collection and PT Dashboard to the previous paragraph. \ d. Remove or rephrase other points in the paper that emphasize leveraging the iPod, including the second paragraph of Technology Probe for In-Home Physical Therapy: â€œSenseCapâ€_ leveraged the self-contained nature of the iPod Touch 4Gâ€_ there are no extra components to concern patientsâ€_â€ù. \ e. Strengthen introductionâ€™s ties to prior literature on â€œrehabilitation technology in the homeâ€ù by adding paragraphs shown in the rebuttal. \  \ 2. Bolster the findings/discussion section by clarifying and further reflecting on novel insights gained. \ a. Add paragraph included in the rebuttal, which extends prior art findings on patientsâ€™ home-location preferences. \ b. Add further discussion on over-compliance, including the PT intervention in the case where the patient spiked to a high number of daily sets. Over-compliance, to our knowledge, has not been documented before, and findings show that this data can be as important to PTs as the much-studied under-compliance data of prior art. \ c. Reorganize the other findings to be more salient and discuss them in relation to prior art. Included among these findings are â€œ1) what to capture about patients' home-based exercises and 2) how to support communication and interaction with the informationâ€ù as highlighted by AC3.  \  \ 3. Clarify the system validation procedure to address a concern of AC2 and AC3. \ 4. Implement other changes as outlined in the rebuttal, including toning down overstatements, clarifying charts, and so forth. \ ",,Kevin Huang,Sara Kiesler,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:21,pn2488,A,Social Media Participation and Performance at Work: A Longitudinal Study,N.

Through a study of 75,747 employees of a large global company over the course of 3 years, we find that some social media usage (number of forum posts, forum post length, and status update length) was positively associated with performance ratings.

In this work, we present four experiments examining how two different kinds of â€œsurpriseâ€ù financial incentives affect the rate of participation in a longitudinal study when participants are initially solicited with either an appeal to intrinsic motivation to participate in research or one that also offers extrinsic financial incentives. We find that unexpected financial incentives (â€œexistence surprisesâ€ù) presented to people who click a recruitment advertisement focused on intrinsic incentives lead to a lower recruitment rate than do the same incentives offered to those who clicked an advertisement that led them to expect it. However, when potential participants expect a financial incentive, surprising them with a higher amount (â€œamount surprisesâ€ù) yields a higher recruitment rate. We interpret these results in the context of crowding theory. Neither type of surprise affected ongoing participation, measured as the number of questions and questionnaires completed over the course of the study. ",Paper,Andrew T.

Based on what we promised in the rebuttal and the additional guidance provided by the reviewers, we have substantially updated the paper.  \  \ In addition to general polishing and tightening of the paper, the main changes are as follows: \  \ - CROWDING THEORY: We expanded both our introduction and our interpretation of results with regard to crowding theory (R2/R4), and also added a perspective from the values literature (R4) about individual differences in values. \  \ - NOVELTY: We clarified that the application of crowding theory to research recruitment is novel (R4). \  \ - REPETITIVENESS: We condensed the results substantially to be more concise and less redundant with the tables (R1/R3/R4). \  \ - SEPARATE STUDIES: We changed ""Study"" to ""Experiment"" throughout with reference to our four trials, reserving the term ""study"" for the larger online dating study within which the experiments were conducted. \  \ - ""CONTROL"" CONDITION: We explained further why the no-money, no-surprise condition is mentioned only in passing and clarify the limitations around that comparison (R1, R4). \  \ - SAMPLE SIZE: We added a bit to the Method section to address the variation in sample size (R3) due to considerations of the larger study. \  \ - SIGNIFICANCE/EFFECT SIZE (R3): We added percent difference in the results text for those significant results where it wasn't already present as a measure of effect size. \  \ - ""RETENTION"": We provided simpler descriptions of dependent measures (R1) and corrected the mistake regarding point (3) on p.3.  We changed the term ""retention"" to ""ongoing participation"" for clarity. \  \ - COST EFFECTIVENESS: As per R3's suggestion, we now report average (expected) cost per 1,000 participants rather than incentive cost per 100 questions answered.  We also clarified our comments about ""arguing for expensive incentives"" and made clear that paying participants simply to provide compensation is a good reason to do so even if there are no clear recruitment-rate benefits. \  \ - PAYMENT TIMING (R3): We already discuss this in methods and limitations, but we now mention the deferred payment schedule earlier in the paper. Pre- vs. post-payment is already discussed in the lit review. \  \ - INCENTIVE SIZE: We clarify that we chose the two levels, and in particular $60, to create the contrast between a typical and an unusually large incentive (R3). \  \ - DECEPTION (R3): We noted that the surprise element is a form of deception.  \  \ - REFERENCES (R1):  We standardized the formatting of references, including correcting the one that R1 identified, added a couple more references to support the additions above. \ ",,Andrew Fiore,Coye Cheshire,earlyrelease,ContentComplete,,9/18/14 20:17,pn2490,A,The Influence of Aesthetics in Usability Testing: the Case of Dual-Domain Products,Andreas,Sonderegger,andreas.sonderegger@unifr.ch,pn2490-paper.pdf,10,letter,,,"Andreas Sonderegger, Andreas Uebelbacher, Manuela Pugliese, Juergen Sauer","andreas.sonderegger@unifr.ch, andreas.uebelbacher@unifr.ch, manuela.pugliese@unifr.ch, juergen.sauer@unifr.ch",24010,Andreas,,Sonderegger,andreas.sonderegger@unifr.ch,Department of Psychology,University of Fribourg,Fribourg,,Switzerland,,,,,,39140,Andreas,,Uebelbacher,andreas.uebelbacher@unifr.ch,Department of Psychology,University of Fribourg,Fribourg,,Switzerland,,,,,,39141,Manuela,,Pugliese,manuela.pugliese@unifr.ch,Department of Psychology,University of Fribourg,Fribourg,,Switzerland,,,,,,30378,Juergen,,Sauer,juergen.sauer@unifr.ch,Department of Psychology,University of Fribourg,Fribourg,,Switzerland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An experimental study examined whether the effects of aesthetic appeal on usability test outcomes are moderated by usage domain. The aesthetic appeal of a cell phone was experimentally manipulated in both home- and work-based usage domains. The two usage domains were modeled in a usability laboratory. 60 participants completed a series of typical cell phone user tasks. Dependent measures such as performance, perceived usability, and emotion were taken. The results showed that aesthetic appeal had a positive effect on perceived usability but a negative effect on performance. The effects of aesthetic appeal on usability test outcomes were not moderated by usage domain. The results of this study imply that it may be sufficient to test dual-domain products in only one of their usage domains.",Paper,Andreas Sonderegger,andreas.sonderegger@unifr.ch,"1.

Some reorganization of the narrative \  \ Reviewers have noted several ideas and paragraphs in the paper that could be moved or amended for greater clarity. We followed these suggestions. \  \ 2. Greater detail in description of methods \  \ We added more detail on our methods of data collection and choice of instruments for the survey clarifying how we conducted study 2. Since quantitative findings did not add to the main argument, we limited our presentation of these results. We also presented more details on the process we followed in the survey. We renamed themes in Table 1 to match the themes described in the text and amended the caption to clarify the content of the table. We also added definitions for the categories, explaining how the categories relate to each other and the rest of the text.  \  \ 3.

These interfaces may, in fact, reduce the error rate of specific error classes, but may also have unintended consequences. In this paper, we show a series of studies where a better interface did not reduce the number of errors but instead shifted errors from one error class (omissions) to another error class (perseverations). We also show that having access to progress tracking (a progress bar) does not reduce the number of errors. We propose and demonstrate a solution â€“ a predictive error system â€“ that reduces errors based on the error class, not on the type of interface.",Paper,greg.trafton@nrl.navy.mil,greg.trafton@nrl.navy.mil,"1.
