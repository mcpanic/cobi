        "abstract": "As the industry evolved from engineering-centered design to user-centered design, organizations created new roles. These user experience (UX) roles are charged with conducting user studies, synthesizing data collected, and communicating findings to product managers, engineers, and UI designers. \\  \\ While it’s generally accepted that user research should be performed, the challenge now is for UX professionals to represent and communicate what we find in ways that are valued and consumable by product teams.  \\ How can we get what we know into stakeholders’ minds so it drives their design thinking? How can we make it compelling so they think about the user data when they are designing? How can we represent the data so that it facilitates ideation?  \\  \\ This SIG creates a forum for people with real-world experience and challenges to discuss their best practices—and missteps—for communicating user research. It does not cover the “how to” details for gathering it. ",

Examples are heart rate monitors for cyclists, jogging apps on mobile phones and GPS sports watches for extreme sports. Despite consumer popularity, there is little knowledge about how they should be designed in order to support the exertion activity. Based on CHI’13’s success of conducting a special interest group outdoors, we propose jogging with technology to discuss sports-support interactive systems and investigate what future opportunities and challenges exist.",

This SIG will be preceded by a workshop “Curating the Digital” that will have as its outcome a research-informed design of the Catalog. The purpose of the SIG will be to open the Catalog design to wider audience participation and discussion, and invite the CHI community to support the development of the Catalog.",

        "abstract": "Food is essential to the survival of the world population. There are several processes in order to make food available to consumers: for example, production, transportation, and consumption. Since the global demand of food is always on the rise, there is a need to improve the efficiency in all the processes in food industries. For example, the food production industries are often not equipped with the right decision-making tools to allow farmers to properly deal with important factors such as environmental changes. On the other hand, tools are not difficult to create but can be very challenging to be successfully adopted by the professionals, especially when the tools require them to change their normal work practices. In this SIG, we will discuss how HCI can improve food product industries with suitable information for each food process.        \\ ",

Having recently been given status as an IFIP (International Federation for Information Processing) TC13 working group, the community now needs to make plans around its academic themes and its coherence as a developing academic community.  \\ The CCI SIG at CHI aims to use a mixture of facilitated creative thinking and a world café approach to bring the community together to tackle these two key challenges.  The CCI SIG will be the natural meeting place for members of this community at CHI and will disseminate its discussion to the CCI and CHI communities through the production of visual and interactive materials at the CHI conference. \\ ",

During the previous CHI conference, there were a growing number of game-oriented submissions demonstrating the increased importance of the field. In 2014, the successful Student Games Competition and the Games User Research workshop (in its third iteration) continue to tie together students, researchers and practitioners. Games and Entertainment is one of the five research areas that have been selected as Spotlights in CHI 2014. Given the increase in quantity and variety of submissions, and the involvement and engagement of practitioners within the community, it is important for the community to have this SIG as a forum.",
