Practitioners can make use of their ability to draw sketches from an early phase of a project on. It can be valuable not only for the exploration of ideas but also for gathering feedback from stakeholders and to foster a common understanding of requirements and concepts. This course introduces basic sketching techniques and a visual language which participants can immediately apply. It is a hands-on course which allows participants to do a lot of sketching during the session.",

It combines the qualitative richness of longitudinal diary studies, artifacts of a field study, and quantitative data of a large-scale survey or app tracker. Using a free, open-source mobile app called “PACO (Personal Analytics COmpanion),” we can conduct ESM studies with participants anywhere in the world. These studies can be conducted after qualitative studies (e.g., ethnography, interviews) to ascertain how broadly your observations apply to your user population or they can be done in advance to identify insights you want to study in-person, in-depth. By combining these methodologies, you create a, deeper, more holistic understanding of your users. This workshop will give attendees the skills to design, conduct, and analyze data from ESM studies at any scale.",

HCI for complex engineered systems challenges conventional HCI solutions to propose new kinds of approaches that turn out to be very useful for solving HCI complex problems. Participants will design devices usable on Earth using accumulated knowledge and tips from aerospace experience. Creativity, in the sense of synthesis and integration, and design thinking will be at the center of this course, where participants will learn how to state and solve a complex design problem, and deliver the resulting product.",

Meeting such an aim will involve a crossing of disciplines, of methods, and a new way of thinking about what technology should be doing for us. By turning to the well-established research and methods available in psychology, education, neuroscience, and HCI, we can begin to cultivate a field dedicated to the design and development of technology that supports wellbeing and human potential, a field we refer to as positive computing [1]. In this course we will explore multidisciplinary approaches to evaluating and designing for digital experience that supports wellbeing determinants like self-awareness, autonomy, resilience, mindfulness, and altruism. The objective of this course is to provide participants with: a theoretical foundation, a practical framework, a look at the state of the art, and group-generated design strategies to better support wellbeing in their current and future projects.",

        "abstract": "HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines – despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces.  \\  \\ The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that CHI researchers and general HCI, UI, and UX practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.",

        "title": "Rapid Design Labs—A Tool to Turbocharge Design-Led Innovation",
        "abstract": "We as researchers and User Experience (UX) designers want to identify and create products that change the world and therefore, we choose to engage in strategic research and design. In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design doesn’t mean it will automatically be accepted or get to market. By definition, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have anti-innovation antibodies [1] that often kill new ideas [2]—even disruptive innovations [3] that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need new tools to meet this challenge—tools that empower UX teams in both business and universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs—a design-led, facilitative, cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who systemically identify new ideas, and align multi-disciplinary teams around their ideas. Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping. Learn how innovative companies and universities, such as Splunk, Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, the Berlin Technical University, Yahoo!, Mindjet, zSpace, HP, and more identify, design, and bring great products to market.",

Attendees will be introduced, interactively, to the many issues that are present when displaying text on screens, including poor interface choices, and affordances that have been badly migrated from paper. In the process, we will explore how future designs can support greater immersion and accessibility without compromising on readability.

However, there is a wide gap between quick-and-dirty surveys, and surveys that are properly planned, constructed, and analyzed. This course examines survey research approaches that meet HCI goals, selecting the appropriate sampling method, questionnaire design best practices, identifying and avoiding common survey biases, and questionnaire evaluation. Attendees will gain an appreciation for the breadth and depth of surveys in HCI, combined with keys to conducting valid, reliable, and impactful survey research themselves.",

While there are common practices, what actually works best in these situations?  What kinds of search tasks are the users actually trying to accomplish when they do a search?  In this course, we’ll review the search and findability issues that users confront in the course of their tasks, and ways in which information can be found.  We’ll also discuss the ways in which users seek information in social settings.  You will learn several key design principles for creating your own search interfaces, as well as coming to understand what is driving people to search.  ",

Whereas much of today’s \\ mainstream Human Computer Interaction (HCI) \\ research addresses functional concerns – the needs of \\ users, practical applications, and usability evaluation – \\ Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms (transformable \\ physical materials) are driven by vision [Fig.1]. This is \\ because today's technologies will become obsolete in \\ one year, and today's applications will be replaced in 10 \\ years, but true visions – we believe – can last longer \\ than 100 years. This course introduces the trajectory of \\ our vision-driven design research from Tangible Bits \\ towards Radical Atoms, and a variety of interaction \\ design projects that were presented and exhibited in \\ Media Arts, Design, and HCI communities. Especially, \\ we focus on the recent development in the two streams \\ of Radical Atoms: 1) Dynamic Shape Display, and 2) \\ Programmable Materials.",
