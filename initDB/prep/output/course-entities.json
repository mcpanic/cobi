        "title": "Methods of Design Synthesis – Moving from Data to Innovation",
        "abstract": "User-centered design research activities produce an enormous quantity of raw data, which must be systematically and rigorously synthesized in order to extract meaning and insight. Unfortunately, these methods of synthesis are poorly documented and rarely taught, and because of the pragmatic time constraints associated with working with clients, there is often no time dedicated in a statement of work to a practice of formal synthesis. As a result, raw design research data is inappropriately positioned as insight, and the value of user-centered research activities is marginalized – in fact, stakeholders may lose faith in the entire research practice, as they don’t see direct return on the investment of research activities.  \\  \\ Design synthesis methods can be taught, and when selectively applied, visual, diagrammatic synthesis techniques can be completed relatively quickly. During synthesis, Designers visually explore large quantities of data in an effort to find and understand hidden relationships, to extract insight, and to look at complexity in new ways. These visualizations can then be used to communicate to other members of a design team, or can be used as platforms for the creation of generative sketching or model making. The action of diagramming is a way to actively produce knowledge and meaning, and a way to provoke a process known as sensemaking.  \\  \\ This skills-based course will introduce various methods of synthesis as ways to translate research into meaningful insights. Course participants will learn about how to manage the complexity of gathered data, and through hands-on exercises, they will apply various synthesis methods to elicit hidden meaning in gathered data. This hands-on approach is critical for building both confidence and ability with the various synthesis methods that are discussed.  \\ ",

        "abstract": "A crucial step in designing a user interface for a software application is to design a coherent, task-focused conceptual model.  With a CM, designers design better, developers develop better, and users learn and use better.  Unfortunately, this step is often skipped in software design, resulting in incoherent, arbitrary, inconsistent, overly-complex applications that impede design, development, learning, understanding, and use.  This course is based on the presenter's (coauthored) book: Conceptual Models: Core to Good Design.  It covers: What CMs are, how they improve software design and development, how UIs based on CMs provide a better fit with human learning and cognition, perils of skipping CMs, object/operations analysis (part of designing a CM), examples of CMs, and a hands-on exercise designing a CM for a simple application.",

Working in pairs, attendees will take turns acting both as investigator (i.e., instructing the participant, observing and recording data) and as participant (i.e., performing tasks as instructed).  The data collected will be analyzed during the break and the results will be presented in the second session.  The second session will also include a demonstration on how to write a successful CHI paper, including pitfalls to avoid. \\  \\ Attendees require no specific background other than a general knowledge of human-computer interaction as conveyed, for example, through an undergraduate HCI course or attendance at CHI conferences.

Attendees will discover that the wide spectrum of available UIs makes it possible for almost anyone to use information technology.  However, they will also experience examples of how this UI model breaks down when the software, document, form or website users are trying to access is designed in a way that fails to support user diversity. Current models are dependent on designers, developers, and authors to create products that are accessible, and these models are largely failing.  \\   \\ Despite laws that require accessible design, and standards and guidelines that define it, people with disabilities still face daunting barriers that prevent them from accessing technology. This course will explore this problem in some depth, and participants will brainstorm possible solutions. \\   \\ This course is intended for all audiences.  Everyone who designs or develops interfaces, and everyone who authors content, should be aware of how the interface or content they create affects individuals with disabilities. Attendees will learn current techniques and best practices for minimizing accessibility barriers, and will have an opportunity to contribute to the discussion regarding possible alternative solutions.  \\ ",

        "abstract": "Speech remains the \"holy grail\" of interaction, as this is the most natural form of communication that humans employ. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines - despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research effort, in engineering, linguistics and psychology, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand and synthesize speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating interfaces that use speech and natural language as an input or output modality. While the accuracies of understanding speech input are still discouraging for many applications under less-than-ideal conditions, several interesting areas have yet to be explored that could make speech-based interaction truly hands-free. The goal of this course is to inform the HCI community of the current state of speech and natural language interaction research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and synthesis work, what are their limitations, where are they currently used in interactive and multimodal systems, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.",

        "abstract": "We as researchers and User Experience (UX) designers want to identify and create products that change the world and therefore, we choose to engage in strategic research and design. In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design doesn’t mean it will automatically be accepted in the research community or get to market. By definition, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have anti-innovation antibodies that often kill new ideas—even disruptive innovations that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need new tools to meet this challenge—tools that empower UX teams in both business and universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs—a design-led, facilitative, cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who systemically identify new ideas, and align multi-disciplinary teams around their ideas. Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping. Learn how innovative companies, design firms, and universities identify, design, and bring great products to market.",

        "abstract": "Interaction with computers is not limited to the interaction in stationary settings anymore. Smartphones, tablet computers and smart watches already replaced PCs as the most successful digital devices. People use mobile devices in all kinds of settings and for a truly broad range of tasks. This makes mobile interaction design not only challenging but also has the potential to have tangible impact. \\  \\ This course provides an overview about research and development in the mobile human-computer interaction field. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the different research methods that are used in the field. It will outline the typical usage contexts in which mobile devices are used today, provides design guidelines for mobile UI design, and presents latest research in the domain. \\  \\ The course will mix discussion of research with exercises designed to help attendees become aware of the opportunities when designing interfaces to support mobile users, as well as the complexities involved when those interfaces are used in everyday life. Our aim is to empower attendees to build effective and efficient interfaces that are a pleasure to use. We want attendees to leave the course with a fresh perspective on their current projects and inspire them to build the next generation of mobile services.",

        "abstract": "The Design of Everyday Things [1](DOET) was first published 25 years ago, in 1988. Even though the fundamental principles of human interaction introduced in that book are still true, a lot has changed since then. The examples in the book reveal its age but more importantly, the technology of interaction has changed.  \\  \\ The new DOET maintains the same basic structure with the same fundamental design principles.  But new material has been added.  First, I added the role of emotion, beauty and pleasure to the original DOET’s emphasis on utility and understanding. Second, I added two chapters about the role of Design Thinking and how these principles work in the world of business. What are the constraints of the installed base, legacy products, and consumer readiness? What about time and budget? Among other things, I introduce Norman’s Law: The day the product team is assembled, it is behind schedule and over its budget. \\  \\ Technologies disappear, but the needs they satisfied often remain. Phonographs, slide projectors, and film have disappeared, but music, illustrated talks, and photographs still exist. Doors, water taps, and light switches may remain the same, but automobiles will drive themselves, machines are becoming more intelligent, more fully autonomous, taking over many tasks we do ourselves, anticipating our desires. And often they will get it wrong. What design rules must change? How shall we design in the 21st century? \\ Reference \\  \\ [1]\tNorman, D. A. (2013).
