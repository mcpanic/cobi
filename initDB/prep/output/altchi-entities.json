        "abstract": "Despite the present abundance of approaches and information related to creative thinking, three basic human traits have been completely overlooked although that, if cautiously used, can considerably contribute to the creative process. Not coincidentally, these traits are also the ones that education has traditionally demonized and designated as its major enemies: stupidity, ignorance and nonsense. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the positive aspects of these defamed traits but also provide practical advice on how they can be used for sparking and nurturing creative thinking and innovative design.",

        "abstract": "Finding participants for experiments has always been a challenge. As technology advanced, running experiments online became a viable way to carry out research that did not require anything more than a personal computer. The natural next step in this progression emerged as crowdsourcing became an option. We report on our experience of joining this new wave of practice, and the difficulties and challenges we encountered when crowdsourcing a study. This led us to re-evaluate the validity of crowdsourced research. We report our findings, and conclude with guidelines for crowdsourced experiments.",

There is growing interest in mining these resources for task modeling, automation, machine-guided help, interface search, and other applications. As a first step, past work has shown success in extracting individual commands from textual instructions. In this paper, we ask: How much further do we have to go to more fully interpret or automate a tutorial? We take a bottom-up approach, asking what it would take to: (1) interpret individual steps, (2) follow sequences of steps, and (3) locate procedural content in larger texts.",

        "abstract": "Research through design as a form of research inquiry is becoming a more common approach within HCI and Design. However, questions as to how research generated through this approach is validated, disseminated and perceived are of current debate. This paper describes the ethos and approach of a recent conference (Research Through Design (RTD)), which introduced a novel format foregrounding the research artifact through both exhibition and dialogical round-table discussion sessions. We document critical reflections from organizers and delegates, which demonstrate how this format offers a more synergistic approach for the dissemination of ‘research through design’, and discuss key practical and philosophical challenges therein, contributing to a broader discussion of what it means to practice research through design as a form of inquiry.",

Initially Brainput was found to improve performance on a human-robot team task by adapting a robot's autonomy using NIRS-based classifications of the user's multitasking states. However, the failure to find any performance improvements in a follow-up study prompted reinvestigation of the original system via a reanalysis of Brainput's signal processing on a larger NIRS dataset and a placebo-controlled replication using random (instead of NIRS-based) state classifications. This reinvestigation revealed confounds in the original study responsible for the initial performance improvements, thus indicating that further work in signal processing is necessary to achieve reliable NIRS-based BCIs.",

She needs to grow into more than a piece of PR, and maybe, if we could only work out our differences, just maybe, think of the magic we might make together.",

Broadcasters see this as an \\   opportunity to enhance a TV programme through the provision of \\   additional information to the `second screen', but determining how \\   to optimise this experience is one of the grand challenges currently \\   facing content providers. Addressing this issue requires a detailed \\   understanding of interaction with both the TV and the secondary \\   device, but this new form of HCI, as much about passive consumption \\   as active interaction, is not well represented by typical task-based \\   paradigms. This paper describes experiments that use eye tracking to \\   understand one of the key components of this new area of study --- \\   determining which device is currently receiving the user's attention \\   -- and discusses the considerable challenge of accurately monitoring \\   attention while maintaining ecological validity. \\ ",

We distinguish 'critical', 'supportive', 'discerning' and 'keen' reviewers, with distinctive contributions for two resources of meaningful numeric evaluation: intersubjectivity and intra-personal commensurability. The acceptance decision is associated with the average paper grade and, to a lesser extent, with the number of paper reviews. We identify four categories of articles that reflect the article distribution of reviewer types.",

However, within the medical sciences the notion of concordance also exists. Concordance promotes negotiation between the patient and healthcare professional for forging a therapeutic alliance. However, the HCI community has still not adopted concordance as a design ideal. This paper revisits four old design-cases to explore the role of concordance in out-of-clinic healthcare. We argue that concordance, as a design ideal, can guide new designs that promote a more active patient-role both at the clinic and beyond.",

Specifically, the form and language of erotic BDSM romance fiction, a genre that deals specifically with the nature of power in relationships, and which has proved extremely popular recently, are used as a means for provoking reflection on the nature of power in the human-computer relationship. Three sexually explicit scenarios are presented, in which technology is portrayed in a dominant and controlling role, highlighting the often subservient and apologetic nature of human interaction with technology. We suggest that readers offended by graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual behaviour do not read further than this abstract.",

It can be difficult to remember where you have been online and consequently hard to get a sense of how much time you have spent, what you did, and why. Web browsers are limited to bookmarks and browser history for retrospective examination. This study is focused specifically on a narrative construction of browser history and the resolution of the resulting experience. The paper establishes a methodological and theoretical connection between expressions of browsing activity and the tradition of narrative enquiry and suggests a range of experimental outputs.",

Medical images are usually considered as ordinary objects and their potential intimate value is never really considered. In this paper, we present an exploratory installation which anticipates prospective issues when medical and self-images interfere with each other. Primary Intimacy of being acts as a digital mirror reflecting the users' bodies with three-dimensional avatars, which are computed in real time from three medical imaging modalities (Fig. 1). A first evaluation reveals individual differences between users with respect to their personal privacy concerns while interacting with the installation. Thereafter, these issues may be probed in the scope of self-portraying. ",

While constructing artifacts to interact directly with everyday materials and contexts, we’ve found it important to approach the IoT from the very lowest levels of hardware to avoid both abstracting away from real knowledge of the platform itself as well as to reduce implementation cost for massive deployment. \\  \\ Building new, inexpensive platforms that augment everyday objects in minimal ways is our proposal for an alternative to top-down control of IoT devices. We intend to move towards interactions among and between things as a bottom-up design study into ubiquitous small-scale computing and its potential aesthetic applications. \\ ",

We reject the status quo that defines what language and forms are appropriate “contributions” for this staid “community” of quasi-scientific poseurs. We argue that CHI in particular is a tool that serves to reinforce the political and ideological status quo, favouring sell-out researchers wielding arcane verbiage and p-values, all paid for by corporate and government interests that reward the building of systems that distract, subdue and subjugate. We present our manifesto for Punk HCI, which celebrates principles of anarchy and freedom in exploring the impact of technology on human culture, values, social structures and psychology. We encourage research motivated by passion and dissent over patents.",

Such a problem presents particular challenges when, as is common, neither the user nor the researcher has access to the actual proprietary algorithms at work.",

It is quite arduous, if not impossible, to read all of these papers. One approach to deal with this information deluge is to focus on skimming through lots of papers in a short period of time, so that one can more wisely choose what to read before investing time in them. In order to teach such a skimming technique, I have taught graduate-level students in an HCI course a technique, called \"Quick and Dirty Review (QnDReview).\" The method has been employed in the course for five semesters, and students' responses were collected and analyzed. Results showed that students spent, on average, 4.3 minutes per paper and believed that they got the gist of each paper. However, the largest benefits I noticed are that students get the overall pictures of the fields and generate interesting ideas while exposing themselves to various new ideas through this approach.",
