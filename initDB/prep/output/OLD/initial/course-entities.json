        "abstract": "A crucial step in designing a user interface for a software application is to design a coherent, task-focused conceptual model.  With a CM, designers design better, developers develop better, and users learn and use better.  Unfortunately, this step is often skipped in software design, resulting in incoherent, arbitrary, inconsistent, overly-complex applications that impede design, development, learning, understanding, and use.  This course is based on the presenter's (coauthored) book: Conceptual Models: Core to Good Design.  It covers: What CMs are, how they improve software design and development, how UIs based on CMs provide a better fit with human learning and cognition, perils of skipping CMs, object/operations analysis (part of designing a CM), examples of CMs, and a hands-on exercise designing a CM for a simple application.",

        "abstract": "Sketching as a technique to quickly draw ideas on a sheet of paper can be used to document, explore and communicate concepts and ideas. Sketches can help to elicit feedback from stakeholders and users in early project phases and therefore prevent from getting on the wrong track. Sketching can furthermore foster the ability to make more convincing ideas to collaborators, managers or clients. Within the user centered design process sketches can be a mean to quickly and inexpensively explore interaction concepts. They can be used to create storyboards and inform wireframes and prototypes.  \\  \\ However, the task of producing sketches can be challenging, especially if drawing skills are lacking. In this course, participants will be introduced to basic sketching techniques and a visual language, which they can immediately apply in research or practice. It is not a theoretical course but rather a lot of hands-on exercise for the participants.  \\  \\ During the course participants will learn: \\ • how to communicate visually  \\ • how to visualize ideas just on the spot  \\ • and how to use drawing to organize and refine thinking. \\  \\ Everybody is welcome to this course and there are no prerequisites. However, it is most valuable for practitioners such as user experience professionals, requirements engineers or product managers, as well as researchers and students in the field of human computer interaction.  \\  \\ The course is given by Stephanie Foehrenbach (M.Sc., Dipl. Inform. (FH)). Stephanie is a usability lead consultant and trainer employed by Zuehlke in Switzerland. She works for clients from various industries. \\ ",

        "abstract": "One novel part of the design of interactions between people and computers, related with the facet of securing user satisfaction, is the capability of systems to adapt to their individual users showing empathy. Being empathetic implies that the computer is able to recognize user’s affective states and understand the implication of those states. Automatic detection of affective states requires the computer: to sense information; to process and understand information integrating several sources that could range from brain-waves signals and biofeedback readings, passing from gestures recognition, to posture and pressure sensing; and to apply algorithms and data processing tools to understand user’s affective states. \\  \\ Through this course, attendees will:  \\  \\ a)\tLearn about sensing approaches used to detect affective states: brain-computer interfaces, face-based emotion recognition systems, eye-tracking system, and physiological sensors –including skin conductivity, posture, and pressure sensors—. \\  \\ b)\tUnderstand the pros and cons of the diverse sensing approaches used to detect affective states. \\  \\ c)\tLearn about the data that is gathered from each device and understand its characteristics. \\  \\ d)\tLearn about approaches and tools to pre-process, synchronize, and analyze data. \\  \\ This course is open to researchers, practitioners, and educators interested in incorporating affective computing as part of their adaptive and personalized technology toolbox. \\  \\ The presentation will be a mix of enthusiastic instruction with demonstrations and exercises, all aimed to help making the topic concrete, memorable, and actionable. \\ ",

Attendees will discover that the wide spectrum of available UIs makes it possible for almost anyone to use information technology.  However, they will also experience examples of how this UI model breaks down when the software, document, form or website users are trying to access is designed in a way that fails to support user diversity. Current models are dependent on designers, developers, and authors to create products that are accessible, and these models are largely failing.  \\   \\ Despite laws that require accessible design, and standards and guidelines that define it, people with disabilities still face daunting barriers that prevent them from accessing technology. This course will explore this problem in some depth, and participants will brainstorm possible solutions. \\   \\ This course is intended for all audiences.  Everyone who designs or develops interfaces, and everyone who authors content, should be aware of how the interface or content they create affects individuals with disabilities. Attendees will learn current techniques and best practices for minimizing accessibility barriers, and will have an opportunity to contribute to the discussion regarding possible alternative solutions.  \\ ",

        "abstract": "Speech remains the \"holy grail\" of interaction, as this is the most natural form of communication that humans employ. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines - despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research effort, in engineering, linguistics and psychology, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand and synthesize speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating interfaces that use speech and natural language as an input or output modality. While the accuracies of understanding speech input are still discouraging for many applications under less-than-ideal conditions, several interesting areas have yet to be explored that could make speech-based interaction truly hands-free. The goal of this course is to inform the HCI community of the current state of speech and natural language interaction research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and synthesis work, what are their limitations, where are they currently used in interactive and multimodal systems, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.",

        "abstract": "The Glass Class: Designing Wearable Interfaces \\  \\ The development of Google Glass and other recent wearable computers has created a significant interest in wearable user interfaces. However there has been little information available on how to create effective wearable experiences. This course will to provide an overview of interface guidelines for wearables and information about the tools available for rapid prototyping and research on a range of different wearable platforms. \\  \\ The course begins with an overview of wearable computing and currently available technology. Key interface design guidelines will be presented using user-centered design principles. Then we introduce a set of tools for quickly prototyping wearable experiences. Finally we will discuss topics for future research and highlight work in these areas. \\  \\ The material will be presented though slides and videos, and attendees will be able to have hands-on experience with Google Glass and other wearable systems. We will also make available prototyping tools, sample source code and key publications. The course will provide attendees with all the material needed to start building wearable applications. \\  \\ The intended audience is interface developers and researchers who are interested in moving into wearable computing. No prior experience is assumed, and many of the tools being shown are suitable for non-programmers. \\  \\ The instructors are Mark Billinghurst from the HIT Lab NZ and Hayes Raffle from Google. Mark is an experienced researcher in Augmented Reality and mobile interfaces who spent a sabbatical as part of the Google Glass team in 2012. Hayes has been working as the Interaction Research Lead for Glass since 2010. \\ ",

We briefly review statistical significance and provide examples of bootstrapping.
